# Rationale

The aim of this handbook is to provide specific, systems-based guidance 
on practice at VUMC and the VA. We hope to provide readers with direct 
and actionable guidance, consolidating the combined wisdom of 
generations of residents and faculty experts.  

The Handbook represents a coordinated effort to disseminate details of 
our practice in a standardized, peer-reviewed format. The guidance 
provided by the handbook makes legible evidence-based practice as well 
as the oral tradition of a resident guiding an intern, or an attending a 
resident. We hope that this handbook will inspire confidence and 
learning, whether the reader is an intern on July 1 or a senior resident 
who wishes to refresh their memory of a topic.
