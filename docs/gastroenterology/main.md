Acute Abdominal Pain – Alex Mamunes

General Approach:

- Rule out life threatening causes: Obstruction, Perforation,
    Dissection, AAA rupture, Inferior MI, Ectopic Pregnancy

- History: pain quality/timing/location/severity, aggravating and
    alleviating factors (eating, bowel movements, position),
    nausea/emesis, bowel changes, flatus & prior episodes

- Initial labs: CBC, BMP, LFTs, INR, lactate, lipase, U/A, urine hCG

Nausea & Vomiting – Taylor Riggs

Etiology: VOMMIIT mnemonic

- <u>V</u>estibular: Labyrinthitis, vestibular neuritis, meniere’s
    disease, cerebellar stroke

- Obstruction: adhesions, hernia, volvulus, constipation, gastric
    outlet obstruction

- <u>M</u>otility: gastroparesis, GERD, autonomic dysfunction

- <u>M</u>edications: antibiotics, SSRI, opioids, cannabinoid
    hyperemesis

- <u>I</u>nfection: gastroenteritis, hepatitis, pyelonephritis,
    cholecystitis

- <u>I</u>nflammation: PUD, pancreatitis

- <u>T</u>oxins: uremia, ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, chemotherapy

Evaluation:

- All patients: CBC (leukocytosis, Hgb), BMP (AG, Ca, lytes, AKI),
    LFTs, lipase, lactate, UA

- If risk factors: consider TSH, AM cortisol, troponin, β hCG, UDS

- EKG to eval for ischemia and baseline QTc

- Imaging:

<!-- -->

- If concern for obstruction (abd distention, decreased BMs) KUB,
    consider CT A/P

- If concern for biliary pathology (RUQ pain, abnl LFTs) RUQ U/S

- If vestibular/concern for CNS pathology CTH vs MRI brain

Management: Address underlying cause and stop medications as appropriate

- Many antiemetics prolong QTc, however in patients without underlying
    cardiac conduction abnormality, electrolyte abnormality, or organ
    failure the risk of QTc prolongation leading to significant
    arrhythmia is low.

<!-- -->

- Obtain screening EKG in patients with underlying heart disease,
    electrolyte abnormalities, organ failure or on other QTc prolonging
    meds (antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, antibiotics)

- 4-8 mg of IV Zofran is estimated to prolong QTc by \~6ms

<!-- -->

- Try to pick a medication that will address the underlying etiology
    of nausea

<!-- -->

- If patient does not respond to a medication in a certain class, try
    a medication from a different class (see below)

Diarrhea – Charles Oertli

Background

- \>3 BM/day OR abnormally loose stool

- Acute (\<2 weeks), persistent (2-4 weeks), or chronic (\>4 weeks)

- 95% of acute diarrhea is self-limited & no additional treatment
    needed

- Most cases of acute diarrhea are due to infections

- Non-infectious etiologies become more common with increasing
    duration

- Voluminous watery diarrhea more likely disorder of small bowel

- Small volume frequent diarrhea more likely disorder of colon

- Nocturnal diarrhea suggests an inflammatory or secretory etiology

Acute Diarrhea

Etiology

- Watery diarrhea: viral gastroenteritis (norovirus, rotavirus,
    enteric adenovirus), C. diff, C. perfringens, S. Aureus, Bacillus
    cereus, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Cryptosporidium, Listeria,
    Cyclospora, vibrio cholerae, (Giardia is typically more chronic),
    Tropheryma whipplei, COVID

- Inflammatory diarrhea: Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, EHEC,
    Yersinia, E histolytica, invasive viruses (CMV, HSV), Non-cholera
    vibrio. Look for red flag symptoms (see below).

- Medications, specifically antibiotics

Presentation

- Evaluate for red flags (BATS are Vulnerable vampires)

<!-- -->

- <u>B</u>loody stools,

- <u>A</u>ntibiotics/Recent hospitalization

    - Any antibiotic can cause C. diff; the longer the treatment, the
        > more likely

    - Most common to cause C. diff: Clindamycin \>
        > Penicillins/Cephalosporins/Fluoroquinolones

- <u>T</u>oo many stools: \>6 unformed stools/day

- <u>S</u>epsis (Fever) or <u>S</u>evere abdominal pain

- <u>V</u>ulnerable (Age \>70 yr, immunocompromised, IVDU, IBD,
    pregnant, travel)

Evaluation

- All patients: CBC w/ diff and BMP to eval for leukocytosis (C.diff),
    AKI, electrolyte abnormalities, thrombocytopenia/anemia (HUS),
    eosinophilia (parasites)

- If red flag symptoms or diarrhea \> 7d: ESR/CRP, C.diff, GIPP

- If immunocompromised: consider CMV, MAC, microsporidia

- If abdominal pain: consider CT A/P with IV contrast

- If concern for IBD or hx of IBD: CT Enterography with PO and IV
    contrast

- Blood Cultures if febrile/septic

Management

- All patients: supportive care with PO or IVF, electrolyte repletion

- If C.diff negative or treatment for C.diff started, ok for
    symptomatic treatment with Loperamide

    - Start with Loperamide 4mg x1 then transition to 2mg QID (AC+HS)
        > (maximum 16mg/day)

- If fever or inflammatory symptoms and C.diff not back, ok for
    Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) 30mL or 2 tablets q30min x8

- Indications for antibiotics:

<!-- -->

- GIPP negative for Shigella, 0157:H7 (can precipitate HUS) and
    salmonella (can prolong carrier state)

- Empiric antibiotic therapy ONLY if toxic appearance or high concern
    for progressive illness/decompensation

    - Ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID or levofloxacin 500 mg daily x 3-5 days

    - Azithromycin 500 mg daily x 3 days

    - Ampicillin + gentamicin used for pregnant women to cover for
        Listeria

- C. diff positive (see section below)

</table>

Evaluation

- Labs: CBC w/ diff, CMP, ESR/CRP, TSH, celiac serologies if high
    suspicion (anti-TTG)

- Spot fecal elastase Steatorrhea (greasy, malodorous stools that
    float)

- Colonoscopy indicated if alarm symptoms are present ( \>45 yrs and
    hasn’t had one, or \<45 yrs and concern for IBD, CMV, ischemic
    colitis or microscopic colitis)

- If concern for IBS: Rome IV criteria (see section on “IBS” below)

Management

- IBS: trial elimination diet/low FODMAP, antidiarrheals

- Pancreatic insufficiency: enzyme replacement (Creon), consult
    nutrition for assistance

- Celiac: eliminate gluten, will need outpatient nutrition follow-up

- Bile acid malabsorption: can try cholestyramine (can affect
    absorption of other meds)

Constipation – Chelsie Sievers

Background

- Definition: presence of lumpy/hard stools, straining, use of digital
    maneuvers, sensation of incomplete evacuation, frequency \<3 BM per
    week.

- Common etiologies: opioid-induced, medications (anti-depressants,
    iron, anticholinergics) hypothyroidism, hypokalemia, pregnancy, IBS,
    neurogenic (trauma, MS, Parkinson disease, diabetes, autonomic
    dysregulation).

- Always think about risk of obstruction (prior abdominal surgeries,
    oncology history or risk for GI/GU malignancies, history of
    IBD/Crohn’s).

Evaluation

- Evaluate etiologies plus lifestyle factors (low fiber intake, low
    fluid intake, reduced mobility, acute illness)

- Clinical diagnosis, no need for imaging unless concerned for
    obstruction → KUB/ CT

- BMP + Mg to evaluate electrolytes, consider TSH if chronic

- Rectal exam to exclude rectal mass or fecal impaction
    (constipation + diarrhea doesn’t exclude impaction/obstruction.
    Overflow around mass = encoparesis)

Management

- Stop or minimize offending medications if possible

- Optimize lifestyle factors: out of bed, walking hallways, increase
    fluid intake, + cup of coffee if appropriate.

- Escalating pathway: ensure meds are scheduled not PRN

    - MiraLAX (PEG) 17g BID (can give TID) + Senna nightly (can
        > increase to BID and/or 2 tabs) → Bisacodyl suppository → enema
        > (tap water or SMOG) → stronger osmotic laxative (lactulose
        > 20mg once, Mag-citrate, Golytely) → escalate lactulose dosing
        > 20 – 30 mg q2hrs

- Other considerations:

    - Avoid Fleet enemas (sodium-phosphate) in CKD and geriatric
        > populations

    - “The hand that writes for opioids also writes a bowel regimen”

        - Generally, start with scheduled MiraLAX (PEG) 17g daily +
            > senna nightly

        - If severe and unrelieved by escalating therapies, can try
            > methylnaltrexone

    - Lactulose can cause severe bloating and cramping

    - In patients unable to take PO: place DHT to deliver meds or
        > rectal lactulose (important for patients with cirrhosis with
        > AMS/HE).

    - In patients with CF (at risk for distal intestinal obstruction
        > syndrome): ensure have pancreatic enzymes ordered, managed
        > more like constipation than true obstruction: PO/ NGT MiraLAX
        > QID or Golytely.

    - Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome): \>12cm
        > cecal diameter = severe dilation, risk of perforation. Treated
        > with neostigmine, 2mg IV over 3 to 5 minutes. Monitor for
        > bradycardia, hypotension, and dysrhythmias (relative
        > contraindications: recent MI, asthma, PUD, epilepsy).
        > Decompression with colonoscopy used in some cases.

    - Consider pelvic floor dysfunction, pelvic floor PT may be
        > helpful

Esophageal Disorders – Caroline Barrett

Dysphagia

- Oropharyngeal dysphagia = difficulty initiating a swallow

<!-- -->

- Associated with coughing, choking, nasopharyngeal regurgitation, and
    aspiration

- Causes: Structural (Zenker’s diverticula, malignancy, goiter,
    stricture, radiation injury, infection), Neuromuscular (stroke,
    Parkinson disease, dementia, ALS, MS)

<!-- -->

- Esophageal dysphagia: Difficulty swallowing several seconds after
    initiation; associated w/sensation of food getting stuck in
    esophagus

<!-- -->

- Dysphagia to solids = mechanical obstruction

    - Foreign body: Inability to swallow solids and/or liquids,
        including oral secretions

        - Most common foreign body = food in esophagus

    - Progressive: esophageal stricture, peptic stricture, esophageal,
        cancer

    - Intermittent: esophageal ring/web, eosinophilic esophagitis
        (particularly in young pts)

- Dysphagia to solids and liquids = motility disorder

    - Causes: achalasia, scleroderma, distal esophageal spasm (DES),
        hypercontractile (nutcracker) esophagus

Evaluation

- If oropharyngeal dysphagia: videofluoroscopic modified barium
    swallow and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES)

- When to order barium esophogram:

<!-- -->

- Pre-endoscopy if clinical history suspicious for proximal esophageal
    lesion (i.e. Zenker’s) or known complex stricture (post-caustic
    injury or radiation)

    - Don’t order if a food impaction is suspected or if imminent
        endoscopy

- Post-endoscopy if mechanical obstruction is still suspected (EGD can
    miss lower esophageal rings or extrinsic esophageal compression)

<!-- -->

- EGD if concerns for mechanical obstruction

- Manometry for motility disorders

Management

- Food impaction: IV glucagon to relax lower esophageal sphincter to
    allow food passage

<!-- -->

- Otherwise, requires urgent upper endoscopy for removal

<!-- -->

- Additional management is specific to the final diagnosis

Odynophagia

- Pain with swallowing

- Associated with esophagitis

PIECE mnemonic for esophagitis:

- Pill-induced: NSAIDs, ART, KCl, doxycycline, bisphosphonates

<!-- -->

- Discontinue culprit med or substitute with liquid formulation;
    prevent by taking culprit meds w/ 8oz water and sit upright for 30
    mins after

<!-- -->

- Infectious: usually in immunosuppressed pts

<!-- -->

- Candida esophagitis: most common in HIV or heme malignancies, pts on
    antibiotics and steroid use

    - Can exist without OP thrush

    - Diagnosis: white mucosal plaque-like lesions on EGD biopsy and
        culture

- HSV esophagitis. Occurs most commonly in solid organ, BMT transplant
    recipients, and immunosuppressed patients

    - Diagnosis: well-circumscribed ulcers on EGD, biopsy or brushings
        of ulcer edge

    - Rx: acyclovir 400mg PO five times daily for 14-21 days
        (immunocompromised) or acyclovir 5mg/kg IV q8h for 7-14 days if
        unable to tolerate PO; 200mg PO five times daily or 400mg PO
        three times daily for 7-10 days (immunocompetent)

- CMV esophagitis: suspect in HIV pts w/ CD4\<50

    - Diagnosis: linear/longitudinal ulcers on EGD, biopsy

    - Rx: ganciclovir 5mg/kg IV q12h for 21-42 days; change to PO once
        pt able to tolerate; If contraindication to ganciclovir
        (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) can use Foscarnet. PO
        valganciclovir can be used in patients who can tolerate and
        absorb oral medications. Treatment duration is 3-6 weeks based
        on expert opinion and response to disease

<!-- -->

- Eosinophilic esophagitis (see below)

- Caustic: alkali-induced injury, acid-induced injury, acute period
    (several days) following esophageal radiofrequency ablation for
    Barrett’s.

- GERD (see below)

GERD

Background

- Condition that develops when reflux of stomach contents causes
    symptoms and/or complications

- Classified base on appearance of esophageal mucosa on EGD

<!-- -->

- Erosive esophagitis: endoscopically visible breaks in distal
    esophageal mucosa + GERD

- Nonerosive reflux disease: presence of symptoms of GERD without
    esophageal mucosal injury

Presentation

- Esophageal symptoms: heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain,
    dysphagia, globus sensation, odynophagia

- Extra-esophageal symptoms: chronic cough, hoarseness

- Complications: Esophageal stricture, Barrett’s esophagus, esophageal
    adenocarcinoma

Evaluation

- Dx can often be made clinically in pts with classic heartburn and/or
    regurgitation

- If dx uncertain, can perform ambulatory pH monitoring + impedance

- EGD indicated for the following:

<!-- -->

- Presence of alarm features (dysphagia, persistent vomiting, GI
    cancer in 1º relative, odynophagia, GI bleeding, weight loss, iron
    deficiency anemia, ≥age \> 60 y/o with new-onset GERD symptoms)

- Risk factors for Barrett’s esophagus (duration of GERD at least 5-10
    years \[must be present\], \>50 yo, male, white, hiatal hernia,
    obesity, nocturnal reflux, tobacco use, first-degree relative w/
    Barrett’s and/or adenocarcinoma)

- Abnormal UGI tract imaging (i.e. luminal abnormalities).

- Continued symptoms despite adequate PPI therapy

Management

- Lifestyle and dietary modifications in all pts (weight loss; elevate
    HOB; avoid precipitants such as fatty foods, caffeine, alcohol,
    spicy foods, large meals, late night meals)

<!-- -->

- Mild/intermittent symptoms (\<2 episodes/wk) and no erosive
    esophagitis step-up therapy q4-8 wks until symptoms are controlled,
    then continue for at least 8 wks:

- Low-dose H2RA prn standard dose H2RA BID (min 2 wks) discontinue
    H2RA and start daily low dose PPI standard dose PPI

<!-- -->

- Frequent symptoms (\>2 episodes/wk, and/or severe symptoms that
    impair QOL) step-down therapy in order to optimize symptom relief

<!-- -->

- Standard-dose PPI daily (8 wks) low-dose PPI daily H2RA (if
    mild/intermittent symptoms) stop if asymptomatic

    - PPIs should be prescribed at lowest dose and for shortest
        duration appropriate

    - Instruct patients on optimal PPI use: most effective at gastric
        acid suppression when taken 30-60 minutes before a meal

    - Taper if taking for \>6 months and plan to discontinue

<!-- -->

- Medications:

<!-- -->

- Low dose H2RA: famotidine 10mg BID

- Standard dose H2RA: famotidine 20mg BID

- Low dose PPI: omeprazole 10 mg daily

- Standard dose PPI: omeprazole 20 mg daily

Additional Information

- Erosive esophagitis and Barrett’s esophagus:

<!-- -->

- Require maintenance acid suppression with a standard dose PPI daily
    given likelihood of recurrent symptoms and complications if stopped

<!-- -->

- Recurrent Symptoms (2/3 of pts with nonerosive reflux disease
    relapse when acid suppression is discontinued):

<!-- -->

- If ≥3 months after discontinuing repeat 8-week course

- If \<3 months of discontinuing EGD (if not already performed) to
    rule out other etiologies or complications

Eosinophilic Esophagitis

Background

- Pt usually with a history of asthma/allergies/eczema

- Dysphagia (most commonly to solid foods), food impaction, central
    chest pain, GERD/refractory heartburn, upper abdominal pain

Evaluation

- Diagnostic criteria

<!-- -->

- Symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction

- EGD with \>15 eos/hpf on biopsy and exclusion of other causes

- 50-60% pts will have elevated serum IgE lvl; peripheral eosinophilia
    can be seen but is generally mild.

Management

- Standard dose PPI for 8 weeks +/- elimination diet if still
    symptomatic after 4 weeks, increase PPI to BID if responsive,
    continue PPI at lowest dose possible for symptom control

- Alternative treatment is swallowed budesonide or fluticasone

- Intermittent dilation of strictures to relieve dysphagia, but no
    effect on underlying inflammation

- Should undergo evaluation by allergist, given strong association
    with allergies

Peptic Ulcer Disease – Michelle Izmaylov

Background

- Ulceration in the GI tract wall extending through the muscularis
    mucosa into deeper layers

<!-- -->

- Most common in the stomach and proximal duodenum

- Less common in the lower esophagus, the distal duodenum, or the
    jejunum

    - ↑ suspicion for unopposed hypersecretory states, like
        Zollinger-Ellison syndrome

<!-- -->

- Causes: NSAID use and Helicobacter pylori \>\> steroids, malignancy,
    and acute stress

Presentation

- Episodic gnawing or burning epigastric pain, 2 - 5 hr after meals,
    nausea, vomiting, heartburn, bloating, postprandial belching, and
    loss of appetite

- Nocturnal pain: acid is secreted in absence of a food buffer

- Classic teaching for ulcers: Gastric (pain worse w/eating); Duodenal
    (pain better w/eating)

- May be asymptomatic until complications such as hemorrhage or
    perforation

- Alarm features: unintentional weight loss, persistent vomiting,
    melena, progressive dysphagia, early satiety, recurrent vomiting,
    palpable abdominal mass, lymphadenopathy, family history of upper
    gastrointestinal cancer, and iron deficiency anemia

Evaluation

- CBC and H Pylori testing if no strong NSAID use history

<!-- -->

- Urea breath or stool antigen (pt needs to stop PPI for 1-2 weeks, to
    avoid false - for both)

<!-- -->

- EGD: if alarm features or patient is older than 55

Management

- General: treat underlying cause (i.e. H. pylori, stop NSAIDs, etc),
    encourage smoking cessation, and limit alcohol intake to 1
    drink/day.

- If complicated peptic ulcer (i.e. bleeding, perforation, or gastric
    outlet obstruction):

<!-- -->

- EGD to determine etiology and for possible treatment

- IV PPI (if bleeding IV PPI for 72 hrs after endoscopic treatment
    oral PPI)

<!-- -->

- If uncomplicated peptic ulcer (not caused by H. pylori):

<!-- -->

- Antisecretory therapy with oral PPI (i.e. omeprazole 20 to 40 mg
    daily):

    - If caused by NSAIDs: Duration: \<1 cm ulcer 4-6 wks; ≥1 cm ulcer
        6-8 wks

    - If not caused by NSAIDs, Duration:

        - Duodenal ulcer: 4 weeks

        - Gastric ulcer: 8 weeks

<!-- -->

- If ulcer caused by H. pylori:

<!-- -->

- Treat with PPI BID for 14 days with an appropriate combination
    antibiotic regimen.

- Confirm H. pylori eradication (via stool antigen test, urease breath
    test, or EGD \>4 weeks after completion of therapy). If not
    eradicated, retreat

Additional Information

- Continue maintenance PPI therapy (omeprazole 20 mg daily) for the
    following:

<!-- -->

- Peptic ulcer \>2 cm and age \>50 or multiple co-morbidities

- Frequently recurrent peptic ulcers (\>2 in one year)

- H. pylori-negative, NSAID-negative ulcer disease

- Failure to eradicate H. pylori (including salvage therapy)

- Condition requiring long term aspirin/NSAID use

- Persistent ulcer on repeat EGD (if performed)

<!-- -->

- Indications for repeat EGD (8-12 weeks):

<!-- -->

- Persistent/recurrent symptoms despite medical therapy

- Complicated ulcer (bleeding), with evidence of ongoing bleeding

- Giant gastric ulcer (\>2 cm) or features of malignancy at index
    endoscopy

- Gastric ulcer that was not biopsied or inadequately sampled on
    initial EGD

- Gastric ulcer in pt w/risk factors for gastric cancer (\>50 yo, H.
    pylori, immigrant from high prevalence area \[Japan, Korea, Taiwan,
    Costa Rica\], FHx, presence of gastric atrophy, adenoma, dysplasia,
    intestinal metaplasia)

GI Bleeding – Matthew Meyers

Background

- Intraluminal blood loss anywhere from the nasopharynx/oral cavity to
    the anus

<!-- -->

- Don’t forget epistaxis or oropharyngeal bleeding as possible source
    of melena

<!-- -->

- IV PPI prior to endoscopy may ↓ need for endoscopic therapy but does
    not impact transfusion requirement, rebleeding risk, need for
    surgical intervention, or mortality

- Classification: relative location to the Ligament of Treitz (LoT)

<!-- -->

- Upper = proximal to LoT

    - PUD, gastritis (alcohol, stress, NSAIDs, ASA), esophagitis,
        variceal bleed, Mallory-Weiss tear, AVM, Dieulafoy’s lesion,
        aorto-enteric fistula, gastric antral vascular ectasias,
        malignancy

- Lower = distal to LoT

    - Diverticular bleed, ischemic/infectious/IBD/radiation colitis,
        malignancy, angiodysplasia, anorectal (hemorrhoids, anal
        fissure), Meckel’s diverticulum, post-polypectomy bleed

Presentation

- Hematemesis (very specific for upper GI bleed), hematochezia
    (usually lower although brisk upper possible), melena (usually
    upper), coffee-ground emesis, epigastric/abdominal pain, acute or
    chronic, hx of GI bleed and prior endoscopies, NSAID use, alcohol
    use, anticoagulant use, hx of cirrhosis

- Exam: VITALS – assess stability to determine resuscitation needs,
    MICU vs. floor; orthostatic vs, rectal exam every time (smear stool
    on white tissue paper to look for melena), look for signs of
    cirrhosis (jaundice, palmar erythema, ascites, spider angiomata)

Evaluation

- CBC, PT/INR, CMP, Lactic Acid, Blood Gas

- EGD: usually best

- Difficulty localizing GIB: pill-capsule, balloon enteroscopy
    Meckel’s scan, tagged RBC scan

- Massive lower GI bleeds will require arteriography

Management

- Secure airway (intubation) if comatose, extremely combative, or
    massive hematemesis

- At least 2 large bore IV’s (\> 18 gauge) – ask nurses directly to
    ensure these are placed

- Maintain active type and screen

- Bolus IVF to maintain MAP \>65H/H monitoring q6-q12 hours;
    transfusions as indicated

- IV PPI (pantoprazole) 40 mg BID if thought to be upper/possible
    ulcer

- If cirrhotic, Ceftriaxone 1g daily for empiric SBP prophylaxis

- If possibility of variceal bleed: Octreotide IV 50 mcg x1 then 50
    mcg/hr drip x 3-5 days

- NPO if unstable vs. clear liquids (no reds or purples) until morning
    for EGD

- Never give prep to a patient for colonoscopy (GoLytely) without
    discussing with GI fellow

- Consult gastroenterology to facilitate endoscopy

<!-- -->

- If endoscopy is unable to stop bleeding IR is next who can embolize

- If embolization fails EGS for source removal

Acute Pancreatitis – Alex Wiles

Background

- Common causes: Gallstones (40%), EtOH (30%)

- Other causes: post-ERCP, pancreatic cancer/obstruction, blunt
    abdominal trauma, hypertriglyceridemia (TG \>1000), hypercalcemia,
    drugs (thiazides, protease inhibitors, azathioprine, 6MP), mumps,
    Coxsackie, vasculitis, pregnancy, genetic (PRSS1, SPINK1, CFTR),
    autoimmune (IgG4), scorpion venom

- Several scoring systems:

<!-- -->

- BISAP (BUN \>25, Impaired mental status, SIRS, Age\>60, Pleural
    effusion)

    - 0 – 2 Mortality \< 2%; 3 - 5 Mortality \> 15 %

- APACHE II (MD Calc, several factors)

    - 0 – 8 Mortality \<4%; \> 8 Mortality 11 – 18 %

Presentation

- Must have 2 out of the three:

<!-- -->

- Pain characteristic of pancreatitis (sharp, epigastric, radiating to
    back)

- Imaging characteristic of pancreatitis (US, CT, MRI)

- Enzymes (lipase or amylase) \>3x ULN (use lipase, much more
    specific)

- \*If pain is characteristic and lipase \> 3x ULN, no need for CT A/P

<!-- -->

- Grading Severity:

<!-- -->

- Mild: no organ failure or systemic complications

- Moderate: transient organ failure (\<48 hours)

- Severe: persistent organ failure (\>48 hours)

Evaluation

- Lipase, CBC, CMP, lipid panel, lactate, direct bilirubin

- Obtain RUQ U/S for all pts, evaluates for gallstones

- CT A/P w/ IV contrast if indicated

<!-- -->

- Reserved for patients not improving at 48-72 hour to assess for
    complications

- If performed at onset, underestimates severity (necrosis takes 72
    hours from onset)

Management

- Fluids, Fluids, Fluids:

<!-- -->

- First 12-24 hrs: IVF at 200 to 500 cc/hr, or 5-10 cc/kg / hr (2.5 –
    > 4 L within first 24 hrs)

<!-- -->

- Follow HCT and BUN as markers for successful fluid resuscitation

- Aggressive IVF in first 24 hours reduces both morbidity and
    mortality

- Persistent hemoconcentration at 24 hr is associated with necrotizing
    pancreatitis

<!-- -->

- Pain Control:

<!-- -->

- Common starting narcotic regimen is oxycodone 10 mg q6h PRN and
    hydromorphone 0.5 mg q4h for breakthrough

<!-- -->

- Nutrition:

<!-- -->

- NPO but start PO diet as soon as patient can tolerate (even within
    24 hours)

- Clear liquid diet or mechanical soft and advance as tolerated

- Low fat diet (Fatty acids → CCK → trypsinogen to trypsin)

- If NPO \> 72 hours, attempt PO and if fail, place Dobhoff for
    enteral nutrition at latest by day five… outcomes with NG/NJ \>\>\>
    TPN

<!-- -->

- Antibiotics:

<!-- -->

- Fever, leukocytosis common, not an indication for ABX as the
    necrosis is sterile

- Infection of the necrosis should be suspected with failure to
    improve 7 days after onset

    - Cefepime + Flagyl or carbapenem

- EUS or IR guided drain for aspirate: can be done on immature
    collections for diagnostic purposes but typically only done if
    collection is walled-off—at least 4 weeks

- Endoscopic Intervention (cystogastrostomy) has emerged as first-line
    therapy for symptomatic pseudocysts or walled-off pancreatic
    necrosis , with step-up therapy to video assisted retroperitoneal
    debridement (VARD) or surgery when needed

Additional Information

- If choledocholithiasis on Imaging urgent ERCP for patients with
    cholangitis or obstructive jaundice, otherwise elective ERCP

- If Intermediate probability for choledocholithiasis MRCP or EUS or
    (for patients requiring cholecystectomy Intraoperative cholangiogram

- If biliary sludge but no stones on U/S, still consider
    cholecystectomy (likely microlithiasis)

- Complications:

<!-- -->

- ARDS, abdominal compartment syndrome, AKI, DIC

- \< 4 weeks after pancreatitis: Peripancreatic fluid collection,
    acute necrotic collection

- \> 6 weeks after pancreatitis: Pancreatic pseudocyst, walled-off
    necrosis (WON)

- Most fluid collections should be followed over time as acute
    collections can resolve and are unable to be sampled safely with EUS

<!-- -->

- Gallstone pancreatitis:

<!-- -->

- All pts should have cholecystectomy once recovered (recurrence is
    25-30%) with EGS

- Performed during initial admission in cases of mild acute
    pancreatitis

Chronic Pancreatitis – AJ De Witte

Definition: A syndrome characterized by irreversible chronic progressive
pancreatic inflammation, fibrosis, and scarring, resulting in damage to
and loss of exocrine (acinar), endocrine (islet cells), and ductal cells

Etiology: TIGAR-O mnemonic

- <u>T</u>oxic Metabolic: EtOH, tobacco use, hyperCa (Ca \> 12), HLD
    (fasting TG \> 300, nonfasting \> 500), CKD 5, medications, toxins

- <u>I</u>diopathic: early onset (age \< 35), late onset (age \> 35)

- <u>G</u>enetic: Autosomal dominant (PRSS1 gene), recessive (CFTR,
    SPINK1, etc.)

- <u>A</u>utoimmune: IgG4-related (AIP type 1), AIP type 2

- <u>R</u>ecurrent, severe acute pancreatitis

- <u>O</u>bstructive: pancreas divisum, ampullary stenosis, main duct
    pancreatic stones or strictures, widespread calcifications, mass
    causing duct obstruction

    Presentation:

- Abdominal pain (most common)

- Exocrine insufficiency: diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss

    - Typically occurs later in disease process

- Endocrine insufficiency: diabetes

- Occasionally asymptomatic

    Evaluation:

- Imaging: CT or MRI (may be negative early in course of disease)

    - If CT or MRI negative but suspicion for CP remains high,
        consider EUS +/- biopsy or secretin-enhanced MRCP

- Labs:

    - BMP, LFTs, lipid panel, PeTH

    - Consider genetic testing, especially in younger patients and/or
        patients without clear etiology

    - Pancreatic function testing diagnoses exocrine insufficiency but
        is not necessary for diagnosis of CP

        - Gold standard = 72-hour fecal fat (\> 7g of fat per 100g
            stool per day) - rarely done

        - More practical = fecal elastase (\<100 = diagnostic, 100-200
            = indeterminate)

            - Must be performed on formed stool, can be false positive
                If watery specimen

            - Do not have to stop pancreatic enzymes to measure

    - Lipase and amylase levels can be elevated, but are usually
        normal due to pancreatic scarring and fibrosis

        Management:

- Tobacco and EtOH cessation

- Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy if evidence/diagnosis of
    exocrine insufficiency

    - Usual dose: 50,000 units/meal + 25,000 units with snacks

    - Should take with first bite of a meal and consider adding extra
        enzymes or splitting up dose throughout meal if lasting longer
        than 15 mins

    - If lack of response: try increasing dose, confirm compliance,
        add PPI, split up dose throughout meal, look for concurrent GI
        disorders

- Pain: Tylenol + NSAIDs \> Opioids (Tramadol), consider SSRI/SNRI/TCA
    or gabapentin

    - For refractory pain, other options include celiac plexus
        blockade or total pancreatectomy with islet auto transplant

- Vitamin supplementation + Vit D + Ca

- Consider antioxidants (selenium, ascorbic acid, β-carotene, and
    methionine, vitamin E) – mixed evidence but some studies have shown
    improved pain control

- Routine testing for osteoporosis and fat-soluble vitamin
    deficiencies

Biliary Disease – Alex Wiles

Pearls:

- ERCP is not available at VA: requires fee-basis consult to VUMC,
    contact GI to arrange

- Prior cholecystectomy CBD normally dilates to 10 mm, not pathologic

- Pneumobilia generally indicates performance of prior biliary
    sphincterotomy and/or biliary stent

- CBD dilation classically \> 6mm, but CBD dilates with age: 70 yo
    7mm, 80 yo 8mm; opiates can also cause biliary dilatation

Biliary Colic

- Transient biliary obstruction typically at the GB neck without GB
    inflammation (no fever)

- Presentation: Constant (not colicky) intense, dull RUQ pain and N/V
    for 30 minutes to 6 hours, then resolves, provoked by fatty foods
    (CCK), absent Murphy’s sign

- Biliary colic generally consists of discrete episodes separated by
    weeks to months, and not daily pain

<!-- -->

- Evaluation: Normal (CBC, LFTs, Lipase, Lactate)

<!-- -->

- Imaging: RUQ U/S: cholelithiasis (stones in GB)

- Management: Elective cholecystectomy as outpatient

Acute Calculous Cholecystitis

- Inflammation of the GB from an obstructing stone in the GB neck or
    cystic duct

- Ddx: PUD, pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis, ascending cholangitis,
    IBD, Fitz-Hugh Curtis

- Presentation: Severe constant RUQ pain, fever/chills, N/V, + Murphy
    sign

- Evaluation: CBC (leukocytosis), CMP (mild AST/ALT ↑), Lipase,
    Lactate, BCx x2

- Imaging: RUQ U/S: gallstones + GB wall thickening or pericholecystic
    edema

<!-- -->

- If U/S non-diagnostic (no stones or GB inflammation) HIDA Scan (lack
    of GB filling)

Management: NPO, IVF, IV Abx until resolved or surgical removal

- Urgent Cholecystectomy (\<72H) with EGS;

<!-- -->

- If poor surgical candidate: Cholecystostomy with IR; endoscopic
    drainage options for selected patients (i.e. poor surgical
    candidates also with ascites)

- Complications: gangrenous cholecystitis, perforation, emphysematous
    cholecystitis, chole-cysto-enteric fistula, gallstone ileus

Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis

- Inflammation of the GB without obstructing stone (due to stasis and
    ischemia)

- Presentation: Seen in critically ill/ICU pts; similar history as
    above; may present as unexplained fever or RUQ mass (rarely
    jaundice)

- Ddx: calculous cholecystitis, pancreatitis, hepatic abscess

- Evaluation: Same as acute calculous cholecystitis

- Imaging: GB wall thickening, pericholecystic edema, intramural gas,
    GB distention

Management: Supportive care, antibiotics, GB drainage

- IVF, correct electrolyte abnormalities, NPO

- Broad spectrum antibiotic coverage

- Place CT-guided procedure consult for cholecystostomy placement vs
    Endoscopic drainage (transpapillary cystic duct stent via ERCP or
    cholecystoduodenostomy by EUS)

- Consult EGS if necrosis, perforation, or emphysematous changes
    present

Choledocholithiasis – Anton de Witte

- Obstruction of biliary outflow by CBD stone without inflammation (no
    fever)

<!-- -->

- Impacted cystic duct stone (cholecystitis) with compression of the
    CBD (Mirizzi syndrome)

<!-- -->

- Presentation: RUQ pain (can be painless), N/V and jaundice

- Evaluation: CMP and D-bili (Bili/ALP/ GGT ↑↑↑, AST/ALT mild ↑), CBC
    (Leukocytosis suggests cholangitis), Lipase

- Imaging: RUQ U/S: dilated CBD (ULN is 6mm) MRCP/EUS vs ERCP (see
    below)

<!-- -->

- MRCP preferred given non-invasive but has lower sensitivity for
    smaller stones (consider EUS if still have suspicion despite
    negative MRCP or if patient contraindication to/intolerance of MRI)

Management

- NPO & IVF, pain control PRN

- Stratify risk to determine whether to pursue MRCP (noninvasive,
    diagnostic) vs ERCP

- If any one of the following, patient is HIGH risk consult GI for
    > ERCP + EGS to consider cholecystectomy

<!-- -->

- CBD stone on imaging

- Acute cholangitis

- Tbili \> 4 AND dilated CBD (\>6mm with GB, \> 8mm without GB)

<!-- -->

- If any one of the following, patient is INTERMEDIATE risk consider
    > MRCP (or EUS or cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram)

<!-- -->

- Abnormal liver enzymes

- Age \> 55

- Dilated CBD on U/S with Tbili \< 4

<!-- -->

- If CBD stone seen on MRCP or EUS ERCP,

- If no CBD stone but patient has GB sludge or cholelithiasis EGS
    > consult for cholecystectomy + intraoperative cholangiogram

Acute Cholangitis

- Bacterial infection of biliary tract 2/2 obstruction (typically
    stones) or prior instrumentation (ERCP)

<!-- -->

- Pts with malignant obstruction typically do not develop cholangitis

<!-- -->

- Presentation: Charcot triad (RUQ pain, fever, jaundice); Reynolds’
    Pentad (AMS, Hypotension)

- Evaluation: CBC, CMP (D bili, ALP ↑↑↑) Blood Cultures, Lipase,
    Lactate

<!-- -->

- CRP, AST/ALT can be ↑↑ as well

<!-- -->

- Imaging: RUQ U/S: dilated CBD (ULN is 6mm), no need for MRCP/EUS

<!-- -->

- Consider MRCP overnight if ERCP is not being done emergently

Management:

- NPO, IVF

- Consult GI for urgent/emergent ERCP (generally within 24 hr)

- If ERCP not feasible or fails to establish biliary drainage, can
    consider EUS-guided biliary drainage, percutaneous transhepatic
    cholangiography, or surgical decompression

- Antibiotics for Biliary Disease (IDSA Guidelines):

<!-- -->

- Mild to moderate acute cholecystitis (stable):

    - Ceftriaxone 2g daily, Cefazolin 1-2g q8H

- Cholangitis or Severe acute cholecystitis (unstable or
    immunocompromised):

    - Zosyn 3.375g q8H, Meropenem 1g q8H or Cipro 500 q12H and Flagyl
        500 q8H

    - Healthcare-associated Biliary infections: consider Vancomycin
        (order w/ PK consult)

Gastroparesis – Hashim Hayat

Background

- Syndrome of objectively delayed gastric emptying in absence of
    mechanical obstruction

- Etiology: Diabetes (most common), post-surgical (gastric or
    bariatric surgery), thyroid dysfunction, autoimmune or neurologic
    disorders, medication-induced (GLP-1 agonists, narcotics,
    anticholinergic agents

Presentation

- Nausea, vomiting (may contain food eaten several hours prior),
    abdominal pain (dull, crampy; rarely a predominant symptom), early
    satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, weight loss in severe
    cases

Evaluation

- Exclude mechanical obstruction and mucosal disease with CTE and EGD

- Scintigraphic gastric emptying study = gold standard for diagnosis
    (measures gastric retention of solids at 4h)

<!-- -->

- Stop medications that may affect gastric emptying 48 hrs prior to
    testing

- Must have blood sugar \< 275 (Hyperglycemia delays gastric emptying)

Management

- Support with IVF and electrolytes – PO intake preferred

- Glycemic control in diabetics

- Stop offending medications

- Nutrition consult for teaching on frequent small volume meals that
    are low in fat and soluble fiber

- If continued symptoms after above, try prokinetics and antiemetics

<!-- -->

- Prokinetics

    - Liquid formulations preferred for better absorption

    - Give 15min before meals and at bedtime.

    - First line is Reglan. If no response, try Domperidone and
        subsequently erythromycin (not good for long term, pts develop
        tachyphylaxis)

- Antiemetics: helps symptoms but do not improve gastric emptying

<!-- -->

- In severe cases patients may require enteral feeding (post pyloric
    preferred) or venting g-tube

- Emerging endoscopic treatment options: G-POEM (gastric peroral
    endoscopic myotomy)

Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) – Alex Wiles

Background

- Risk Factors: prior abdominal surgeries (adhesions), malignancy,
    hernia, intestinal inflammation (IBD)/stricture, radiation, abscess,
    foreign bodies

- Indicators for bowel ischemia: fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia,
    peritonitis

- Ddx: early appendicitis, large bowel obstruction, Ogilvie’s, DKA,
    Pancreatitis, IBD, Gastric outlet obstruction

Presentation

- Nausea, emesis, intermittent colic, bloating, constipation

- Obstipation if completely obstructed, loss of flatulence

- Exam: classically with “tinkling” bowel sounds, tympanic abdomen,
    distended abdomen

Evaluation

- CBC, BMP, lipase, hepatic function panel, lactate (sensitive, not
    specific for ischemia)

- Start with KUB to rule out perforation but typically will require CT
    (x-ray only \~80% sensitive)

- CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is optimal study if adequate
    renal function

<!-- -->

- No oral contrast (American College of Radiology (ACR)
    Appropriateness Criteria) as it will not aid diagnosis and can lead
    to aspiration; IV helps evaluate ischemia

- Key word: transition point

- Non-specific signs of bowel inflammation: bowel wall thickening,
    submucosal edema

Management

- Consult EGS: if any concern for SBO, evaluate need for urgent
    surgery

<!-- -->

- Surgical indications complete obstruction, CT with ischemia,
    perforation

<!-- -->

- Gastric decompression: place NGT (prevent aspiration)

- NPO until obstruction relieved and NGT removed

- Fluids: two large bore IVs (nursing communication); LR bolus +
    maintenance while NPO

- If no resolution of partial obstruction at 48 hours:

<!-- -->

- Fluoroscopy Upper GI small bowel ft (follow through)

    - In comments, write “Gastrografin contrast” (water-soluble
        contrast) which osmotically reduces bowel wall edema and aids
        peristalsis

    - If gastrografin reaches the colon within 24 hours, it predicts
        clinical resolution of SBO without surgery

    - Note this can also be therapeutic for pSBO and get bowels moving

Clostridioides Difficile Infections – Anton de Witte

Background

- *Clostridioides difficile* is the causative bacteria for
    antibiotic-associated colitis

- Always consider C. diff in a hospitalized patient with unexplained
    leukocytosis

- Microbiology: Anaerobic gram-positive, spore-forming,
    toxin-producing bacillus

<!-- -->

- Outside colon, exists in spore form – resistant to heat, acid, and
    antibiotics (why we must wash our hands)

- Spores are transferred from environment to person, once in intestine
    convert to functional vegetative, toxin-producing forms susceptible
    to antibiotics

- To be pathogenic, must release toxin (A+B) to cause colitis and
    diarrhea

<!-- -->

- Risk Factors: Antibiotic use (during use or typically up to 1 month
    after use), age \>65, hospitalization, enteral feeding, obesity,
    stem cell transplant, chemo, IBD, cirrhosis, +/- PPI use (no clear
    causal relationship)

Presentation

- Spectrum from asymptomatic carrier to fulminant colitis with toxic
    megacolon

<!-- -->

- Asymptomatic carrier: 20% of hospitalized patients (50% of adults in
    long term care facilities)

- Non-severe disease: watery diarrhea (\>3 unformed stools in 24
    hours), lower abdominal pain, nausea, ± fever, leukocytosis (WBC
    \>15,000)

- Severe disease: diarrhea, diffuse abdominal pain, abdominal
    distention, fever, lactic acidosis, AKI (Cr \> 1.5), marked
    leukocytosis (sometimes \>40,000)

- Fulminant disease: Severe criteria + hypotension/shock, ileus
    (rare), or megacolon (\>7cm colon diameter and/or \>12cm cecum
    diameter)

<!-- -->

- Recurrent disease (relapse \> reinfection): resolution of symptoms
    on therapy followed by reappearance of symptoms within 2-8 weeks
    after stopping therapy; (Up to 25% of patients have recurrence)

- If symptoms never resolve, consider refractory C. diff or
    alternative diagnosis

Evaluation

- Stool PCR for toxigenic strains (very sensitive, can detect
    asymptomatic carriers w/o toxin production); with reflex EIA (enzyme
    immunoassay) for toxins A and B (specificity of 99%)

<!-- -->

- PCR (+)/Toxin (-) = carrier

- PCR (+)/Toxin (+) = treat

- PCR (-) = no treatment

<!-- -->

- Imaging

<!-- -->

- Nonsevere disease: no imaging necessary

- Severe or fulminant disease: CT a/p with oral and IV contrast

<!-- -->

- Endoscopy: Typically used when alternative diagnosis is suspected;
    not warranted for classical symptoms, positive laboratory tests, or
    clinical response to treatment

Management

- Contact precautions until at least 48 hours after diarrhea resolves

- Classify patient disease severity to guide treatment algorithm

- Do not repeat stool testing – 50% remain positive after treatment up
    to 6 weeks later

Inflammatory Bowel Disease – Francesca Raffa

Background

- Ulcerative colitis (UC): colon only (can have backwash ileitis);
    contiguous lesions; mucosal inflammation

- Crohn’s disease (CD): any part of the GI tract; “skip lesions”;
    transmural inflammation

- Important historical considerations to include in your documentation
    and presentation:

<!-- -->

- Location of disease (CD: LB/SB, LB only, SB only; UC: proctitis,
    left-sided or pancolitis)

- Complications: Fistulizing, strictures, perianal, prior surgeries,
    current IBD treatment

- Include last endoscopies and imaging findings; current and prior IBD
    treatment and reason for transition (SEs, failure), primary IBD
    provider

Presentation

- UC: frequent diarrhea (often bloody), tenesmus, urgency, abdominal
    pain; may have fever, malaise, and weight loss

<!-- -->

- Complications: severe bleeding/anemia, fulminant colitis, toxic
    megacolon

<!-- -->

- CD: abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, fever, malaise, weight loss;
    May also have diarrhea (± bloody depending on CD location)

<!-- -->

- Complications: fistulas (entero-enteric, entero-vesicular,
    entero-cutaneous, rectovaginal, perianal, retroperitoneal),
    abscesses, strictures, obstruction

<!-- -->

- Extra-intestinal (EI): arthritis, sacro-iliitis, uveitis,
    episcleritis, aphthous ulcers, erythema nodosum, pyoderma
    gangrenosum, PSC (esp. UC), nephrolithiasis, thromboembolism

Evaluation

- CBC w/diff, CMP, CRP, ESR, ± blood cultures

- If diarrhea: GI Pathogen panel and C. diff

- If anemic: obtain iron studies and type & screen

- If weight loss or concern for malnutrition: albumin, pre-albumin,
    Vitamin D, B12, folate

- Imaging:

<!-- -->

- CT Enterography (oral contrast) preferred in CD, for
    luminal/extra-luminal complications

- How to order CTE: “CT abdomen pelvis enterography”, order barium
    (Volumen) 0.1% oral suspension x2, 1st dose to be given by nurse 60
    min before study, 2nd study to be given 30 min before (nurse should
    be in contact with CT tech)

Management

- Acute Flare

<!-- -->

- Pain control: usually a major component of hospital course

    - Avoid NSAIDs, oral pain medications are preferred

    - If pain is difficult to control, consider Acute Pain Service
        consult

    - Narcotics and Imodium are contraindicated in toxic megacolon

- Antibiotics: appropriately treat infections (intra-abdominal or
    perianal abscess) with antibiotics (consider prior culture data,
    often use cipro/flagyl)

- VTE Prophylaxis: All IBD patients, even if having blood in stool
    (unless requiring transfusion) as they are at much higher risk of
    VTE

- Nutrition: Nutrition consult for all IBD patients; For severe
    malnutrition or if prolonged bowel rest is needed, TPN is sometimes
    initiated

- Anemia: Ferritin \<100 or iron sat \<20 with ferritin \<300,
    consider iron infusions (if no bacteremia) or transfuse for severe
    anemia

- Smoking Cessation (esp. with CD): discuss smoking cessation &
    consult tobacco cessation

- Consult Colorectal Surgery (not EGS): SBO, toxic megacolon, bowel
    perforation, peritonitis

<!-- -->

- Immunosuppression: (Infections must be ruled out and/or treated
    before starting)

<!-- -->

- Steroids:

    - Methylprednisolone (Solumedrol); often 20 mg BID for three days

    - Transition to oral (40 mg prednisone daily) once clinically
        improved/tolerating PO; typically prescribe a prolonged taper on
        discharge (often down by 5 mg every week)

    - If severe proctitis: consider rectal steroids (hydrocortisone
        enema/foam)

- If lack of response to steroids: additional medical therapy
    (biologics), bowel rest with TPN, or surgical intervention

    - Infliximab (Inflectra) is available at VUMC

    - If patient fails to respond to steroids, should consider
        possibility of CMV colitis (usually evaluated by biopsy on flex
        sig or colonoscopy)

    - Prior to initiating a biologic, all patients must have the
        following negative studies within the last year: Quantiferon
        Gold and CXR, Hepatitis B serologies, HIV, urine histoplasma Ag
        (some providers)

Acute Diverticulitis – Michael Koenig

Background

- Inflammation and/or infection of a diverticulum, a small
    out-pouching along wall of colon

- Presence of colonic flora on urine culture or pneumaturia suggests
    colovesical fistula

- Most pts with uncomplicated diverticulitis have significant
    improvement 2-3 days after antibiotics

Presentation

- Lower abdominal pain (85% LLQ), tenderness to palpation on exam,
    N/V, low-grade fever, change in bowel habits (constipation or
    diarrhea)

Evaluation

- CBC w/diff, CMP, Lipase, U/A, β - hCG

- Imaging: CT abdomen/pelvis with oral and IV contrast

<!-- -->

- CT findings: localized bowel wall thickening (\>4mm), paracolic fat
    stranding, presence of colonic diverticula

Management

- Bowel rest vs. clear liquids (advance diet as tolerated)

- PO or IV antibiotics: should cover GNRs and anaerobic organisms

<!-- -->

- Zosyn, cefepime + metronidazole, or meropenem (if high risk for
    organisms w/ESBL)

- Cipro/flagyl if PO

- If low risk and mild disease, may not need antibiotics

<!-- -->

- Continue IV abx until abdominal pain/tenderness is resolved (usually
    3-5 days), then transition to oral: cipro + metronidazole or
    Augmentin to complete 10-14 d course

- Colonoscopy after complete resolution of symptoms (6 – 8 weeks) to
    definitively rule out presence of underlying colorectal cancer
    (unless performed in last year)

Complications:

- Pts who fail to improve or deteriorate require repeat imaging

- Abscess continue antibiotics & percutaneous drainage (if possible)
    for abscesses \> 4 cm

<!-- -->

- Surgery if no improvement 2-3 days after drainage

<!-- -->

- Obstruction: radiographic differentiation between acute
    diverticulitis and colon cancer is difficult; thus surgical
    resection of bowel is needed to relieve obstruction and rule out
    cancer

- Fistula: Rarely heal spontaneously, require surgical correction

- Perforation:

<!-- -->

- Microperforation (contained perforation):

    - Presence of small amount of air bubbles, but no oral contrast
        outside of colon on CT

    - Most treated with IV abx and bowel rest like uncomplicated
        diverticulitis

- Frank perforation:

    - Intraabdominal free air, diffuse peritonitis requires emergency
        surgery

Intestinal Ischemia – Michael Koenig

Acute Mesenteric Ischemia

- Sudden onset ↓ or absence of blood flow to the small intestines

- Mesenteric Arterial Occlusion:

<!-- -->

- Arterial Embolism: Associated with cardiac arrhythmias (atrial
    fibrillation), valvular disease, endocarditis, ventricular aneurysm,
    aortic atherosclerosis, and aortic aneurysm

- Arterial thrombosis: Most commonly from atherosclerotic disease; can
    also be 2/2 abdominal trauma, infection, or dissection

<!-- -->

- Venous thrombosis:

<!-- -->

- Associated w/ hypercoagulable states, malignancy, prior abdominal
    surgery, abdominal mass venous compression, intra-abdominal
    inflammatory processes

<!-- -->

- Non occlusive mesenteric ischemia:

<!-- -->

- Intestinal hypoperfusion and vasoconstriction; associated with
    decreased cardiac output, sepsis, vasopressor use

Presentation

- Early: Abdominal pain is most common symptom, abdominal distension

<!-- -->

- Abdominal tenderness is not prominent early (“pain out of proportion
    to the exam”)

<!-- -->

- Arterial occlusion: Sudden onset, severe periumbilical pain, nausea,
    and emesis

- Venous thrombosis: More insidious onset abdominal pain, waxing and
    waning

- Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia: variable location and severity of
    abdominal pain; often overshadowed by a precipitating disorder

- Late: As transmural bowel infarction develops, abdomen becomes
    distended, bowel sounds become absent, and peritoneal signs develop 

Evaluation

- Type and Screen, Lactic acid, BMP, CBC

- Imaging: KUB: Normal in \> 25% of cases

<!-- -->

- Ileus w/ distended bowel loops, bowel wall thickening, ± pneumatosis
    intestinalis

- Free intraperitoneal air immediate abdominal exploration

<!-- -->

- CT Angiography: no oral contrast, obscures mesenteric vessels, ↓
    bowel wall enhancement

<!-- -->

- Focal or segmental bowel wall thickening, intestinal pneumatosis,
    portal vein gas, porto-mesenteric thrombosis, mesenteric arterial
    calcification, mesenteric artery occlusion

Management

- General: IVFs, NPO, hemodynamic monitoring and support (try to avoid
    vasoconstricting agents), anticoagulation, broad-spectrum
    antibiotics, pain control

- If develops peritonitis or evidence of perforation on CT EGS consult
    for surgery

- Mesenteric arterial embolism: Embolectomy vs. local infusion of
    thrombolytic agent

- Mesenteric arterial thrombosis: Surgical revascularization vs.
    thrombolysis with endovascular angioplasty and stenting

- Venous thrombosis: Anticoagulation; possible thrombolysis if
    persistent symptoms

- Nonocclusive occlusion: Treat underlying cause, stop
    vasoconstriction meds, consider intra-arterial vasodilator infusion

Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia

Background

- ↓ blood flow to intestines, typically caused by atherosclerosis of
    mesenteric vessel

- High-grade mesenteric vascular stenoses in at least two major
    vessels (celiac, SMA, or IMA) must be established

Presentation

- Recurrent dull, crampy, postprandial abdominal pain

- Pts develop food aversion and often have associated weight loss

Evaluation

- CTA abdomen/pelvis is preferred (\>90% sensitivity and specificity)

- Can also consider duplex U/S and gastric tonometry

Management

- Conservative management if asymptomatic: smoking cessation and
    secondary prevention to limit progression of atherosclerotic disease

- Nutritional evaluation

- Revascularization (open vs. endovascular) is indicated if symptoms
    are present

<!-- -->

- Mesenteric angioplasty and stenting is first-line therapy

- Goal is to prevent future bowel infarction

Ischemic Colitis

Background

- Sudden, transient reduction in blood flow to colon

- Typically at “watershed” areas, such as the splenic flexure and
    rectosigmoid junction

- Most often nonocclusive (95% of cases) and affects older adults

- Risk factors: ACS, hemodialysis, shock, aortoiliac instrumentation,
    cardiopulmonary bypass, extreme exercise (marathon running)

Presentation

- Rapid onset, mild cramping abdominal pain, associated with urge to
    defecate, hematochezia

- Tenderness present (typically over left side)

Evaluation

- Lactic acid (nonspecific but elevated), LDH, CPK, CBC
    (leukocytosis), BMP (metabolic acidosis)

- KUB; if peritonitis or signs of severe ischemia → surgery 

- CT A/P with IV contrast (and oral contrast if patient can tolerate)

- Consider CTA A/P if suspicion for vascular occlusion

- Colonoscopy confirms diagnosis. 

<!-- -->

- Edematous, friable mucosa; erythema; and interspersed pale areas;
    bluish hemorrhagic nodules representing submucosal bleeding

- Segmental distribution, abrupt transition between injured and
    non-injured mucosa

Management

- General: IVFs, bowel rest, antibiotics (Zosyn vs CTX/flagyl)

Irritable Bowel Syndrome – Hashim Hayat

Background

- Diagnose by the Rome IV criteria, no longer a diagnosis of exclusion

<!-- -->

- Recurrent abdominal pain on average at least 1 day/week in the last
    3 months with an onset at least 6 months prior, associated
    with **two or more** of the following criteria

    - Pain related to defecation

    - Change in frequency of stool

    - Change in form (appearance) of stool

- Patient has none of the following warning signs: \>50yrs, evidence
    of GIB, nocturnal pain or BMs, unintentional weight loss, family hx
    of colorectal cancer or IBD, palpable abdominal mass or LAD, IDA,
    +FOBT

- Classified based on predominant bowel habits

    - Diarrhea: \>25% BMs with Bristol stool types 6 or 7

    - Constipation: \>25% BMs with Bristol stool types 1 or 2

    - Mixed: both of above

Evaluation

- Thorough H&P for alarm symptoms as above

- Consider limited testing with CBC, CMP, CRP, celiac serology, fecal
    calprotectin

Management

- Treatment involves lifestyle and dietary modifications, psychosocial
    treatment, and pharmacologic treatment

- Pain:

<!-- -->

- Peppermint oil (smooth muscle relaxant) – IBGuard, Iberogast

- Antispasmodics: Hyosciamine acts faster than Dicyclomine

- TCAs: Amitriptyline or nortriptyline (causes less constipation so
    better in IBS-C)

<!-- -->

- Bloating:

<!-- -->

- Low FODMAP diet

- Rifaximin as empiric treatment for SIBO

- No evidence for probiotics (can potentially worsen bloating 2/2
    SIBO)

<!-- -->

- Bowel regulation:

<!-- -->

- IBS-D: Start with Loperamide (up to 16g daily), consider Lomotil if
    refractory

- IBS-C: Miralax, fiber supplement (Ispaghula husk orange), Linzess
    (first line but can be expensive), Trulance, or Amitiza

<!-- -->

- Other

<!-- -->

- Psychotherapy, CBT

- SSRIs, SNRIs for concomitant mood disorders

- Gabapentin, lyrica

GI Manifestations of COVID – Taylor Riggs

Background

- GI manifestations are reported up to 60% of patients with COVID

- GI symptoms may be the only symptom or precede other symptoms
