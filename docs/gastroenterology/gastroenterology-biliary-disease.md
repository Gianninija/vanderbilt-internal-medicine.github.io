# Biliary Disease

## Pearls

- ERCP is not available at VA: requires fee-basis consult to VUMC,
    contact GI to arrange
- Prior cholecystectomy CBD normally dilates to 10 mm, not pathologic
- Pneumobilia generally indicates performance of prior biliary
    sphincterotomy and/or biliary stent
- CBD dilation classically \> 6mm, but CBD dilates with age: 70 yo
    7mm, 80 yo 8mm; opiates can also cause biliary dilatation

## Biliary Colic

- Transient biliary obstruction typically at the GB neck without GB
    inflammation (no fever)
- Presentation: Constant (not colicky) intense, dull RUQ pain and N/V
    for 30 minutes to 6 hours, then resolves, provoked by fatty foods
    (CCK), absent Murphy’s sign
- Biliary colic generally consists of discrete episodes separated by
    weeks to months, and not daily pain
- Evaluation: Normal (CBC, LFTs, Lipase, Lactate)
- Imaging: RUQ U/S: cholelithiasis (stones in GB)
- Management: Elective cholecystectomy as outpatient

## Acute Calculous Cholecystitis

- Inflammation of the GB from an obstructing stone in the GB neck or
    cystic duct
- Ddx: PUD, pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis, ascending cholangitis,
    IBD, Fitz-Hugh Curtis
- Presentation: Severe constant RUQ pain, fever/chills, N/V, + Murphy
    sign
- Evaluation: CBC (leukocytosis), CMP (mild AST/ALT ↑), Lipase,
    Lactate, BCx x2
- Imaging: RUQ U/S: gallstones + GB wall thickening or pericholecystic
    edema
    - If U/S non-diagnostic (no stones or GB inflammation) HIDA Scan (lack
    of GB filling)
- Management
    - NPO, IVF, IV Abx until resolved or surgical removal
    - Urgent Cholecystectomy (<72H) with EGS;
    - If poor surgical candidate: Cholecystostomy with IR; endoscopic
    drainage options for selected patients (i.e. poor surgical
    candidates also with ascites)
- Complications: gangrenous cholecystitis, perforation, emphysematous
    cholecystitis, chole-cysto-enteric fistula, gallstone ileus

## Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis

- Inflammation of the GB without obstructing stone (due to stasis and
    ischemia)
- Presentation: Seen in critically ill/ICU pts; similar history as
    above; may present as unexplained fever or RUQ mass (rarely
    jaundice)
- Ddx: calculous cholecystitis, pancreatitis, hepatic abscess
- Evaluation: Same as acute calculous cholecystitis
- Imaging: GB wall thickening, pericholecystic edema, intramural gas,
    GB distention
- Management
    - Supportive care, antibiotics, GB drainage
    - IVF, correct electrolyte abnormalities, NPO
    - Broad spectrum antibiotic coverage
    - Place CT-guided procedure consult for cholecystostomy placement vs
    Endoscopic drainage (transpapillary cystic duct stent via ERCP or
    cholecystoduodenostomy by EUS)
    - Consult EGS if necrosis, perforation, or emphysematous changes
    present
