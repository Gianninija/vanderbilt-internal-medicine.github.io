# Hypoglycemia 

Will Bassett

---

## Background
-	Definition: BG <70mg/dL
    -	Generally worse outcomes than hyperglycemia
-	Causes: infection, liver failure, iatrogenic (e.g. insulin not adjusted for AKI or being NPO)
-	Symptoms vary from tremor, palpitations, delirium, dizziness, AMS, coma (can mimic stroke)

## Management 
-	Give PO carbohydrate load (15-20g oral glucose) if pt is alert and tolerates PO
-	Give IV D50 if severe (<50), or cannot take PO
-	Repeat measurements every 15 minutes in the first hour and treat again as needed
-	Give glucagon 0.5-1mg SQ/IM if no IV access and impaired consciousness
    -	Effect is transient and IV access should be obtained ASAP for glucose infusion
-	Do NOT hold basal insulin for T1DM: treat the low, then reduce dose if needed
