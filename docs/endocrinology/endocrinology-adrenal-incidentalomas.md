# Adrenal Incidentalomas 

Matthew Gonzalez

---

## Background
-	Adrenal mass >1cm, discovered by chance on radiographic imaging  
-	Less than 1% are malignant 
-	Supportive of benign: <4cm in size, smooth borders, homogenous appearance, <10 HU (Hounsfield units), rapid (>50% washout) contrast washout (on "adrenal phase" imaging)
-	Supportive of malignancy: >4cm in size, irregular borders, > 20 HU on unenhanced CT, delayed contrast washout (<50% washout), tumor calcifications, increase in size over time, presence in young pts and hx cancer

## Evaluation
-	All incidentalomas should be screened for pheochromocytoma (~3% incidence) before operative intervention (24h urine fractionated metanephrines, catecholamines, plasma fractionated metanephrines)
-	Cortisol secreting adenoma (~6% incidence) causing Cushing's syndrome: baseline serum DHEAS, low dose (1mg) overnight dexamethasone suppression test 
-	Aldosterone secreting adenoma (<1% incidence) causing hyperaldosteronism: if hypertensive (HTN) or hypokalemic order plasma aldosterone and renin, confirmatory testing with sodium loading (oral vs IV) and 24h urine aldosterone, sodium, and creatinine

## Management
-	If benign appearing and not hormone producing: interval imaging in ~1 year, and repeat hormone work up
-	Unilateral adrenal incidentaloma
    -	If progression free (stable size, and not hormone producing) can consider monitoring cessation after 4 years 
-	Pheochromocytomas should undergo surgical evaluation for removal
    -	Alpha blockade (phenoxybenzamine) + propranolol prior to resection to avoid HTN crisis
-	Aldosteronoma: should undergo surgical evaluation for definitive treatment; if unable to undergo surgery can use mineralocorticoid antagonist (e.g. spironolactone)
-	Cortisoloma: if clinical significant should undergo surgical removal, will need perioperative glucocorticoid administration to avoid iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency
-	Macroadenomas (masses >4cm) are usually malignant and should be considered for surgical resection due to higher risk of carcinoma
-	Bilateral adrenal incidentalomas
    -	Surgical evaluation + will need adrenal venous sampling to confirm laterality in hormone producing tumors.

## Additional information 
-	There can be coexisting adrenal incidentaloma and bilateral secretion of aldosterone â€“ may require adrenal venous sampling to confirm
-	Not all hyperaldosterone states will have both HTN and hypokalemia
-	Subclinical Cushing's syndrome may be present based on initial dexamethasone suppression test, perform additional testing to determine if clinically significant
