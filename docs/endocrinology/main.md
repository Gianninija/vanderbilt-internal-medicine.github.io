Inpatient Diabetes Mellitus (DM) – Will Bassett

Background

- Blood glucose (BG) goal

<!-- -->

- Wards: \<140 mg/dL fasting; \<180 mg/dL random; increase for
    elderly, “sicker” patients

- ICU: 140-180 mg/dL (NICE-SUGAR Trial)

- Avoiding hypoglycemia in critically ill patients is more important
    than targeting ideal BG

Management

- Initial orders

<!-- -->

- HOLD all home oral diabetes medications (except empagliflozin in
    heart failure pts)

- Always dose reduce home insulin (typically 50-60% of home dose for
    type 2; 80% for type 1) for changes in diet. If AKI present,
    consider reducing by more.

    - Patients with Type 1 DM always need basal insulin, even if NPO
        or else will lead to DKA

- Order set “SUBCUTANEOUS INSULIN ORDER(S)”

    - Hemoglobin A1c. Can consider if none in last 3 months and
        concern for poor outpatient control. A1c does not routinely
        affect inpatient management

    - Fingerstick blood glucose: Typically AC/HS (before meals and
        nightly)

    - Hypoglycemia management: Select all of these

    - Basal insulin:

        - Type 2 DM, consider ↓ home dose (50-60% to home dose) as
            often inpatients have reduced PO intake and ↓ renal function

        - Type 1 DM, DO NOT hold basal insulin, and avoid ↓ \< 80% of
            home dose

        - Unnecessary if no home basal insulin

    - Insulin lispro meal: ↓ home dose by 1/2, do not give while NPO

    - Lispro insulin correction scale: Start with Low or Medium
        sliding scale and ↑ prn

- Carb-controlled or carb-restricted diet

<!-- -->

- Insulin adjustments

<!-- -->

- If BGs persistently \>200

    - Calculate all insulin needs over 24h (basal + mealtime + sliding
        scale)

        - Give 50% as basal and other 50% as 3 divided mealtime doses

        - E.g. 10 basal + 0 mealtime + 14 sliding scale total = 24
            units total daily = 12u basal + 4u TID with meals

        - If new to basal, safe start is 0.2 u/kg daily if normal GFR

- If BGs \< 70

    - If overnight/AM, reduce basal insulin dose

    - If daytime/post-prandial hypoglycemia, reduce mealtime and
        sliding scale

    - Less is more! Blood glucose in the low 200s is better than the
        50s

    - If endocrine consulted for inpatient glucose management, please
        notify \>24h prior to discharge if you want recommended
        discharge regimen

Steroid-induced Hyperglycemia

- Steroids increase insulin resistance causing elevated postprandial
    BG

- Insulin adjustments

<!-- -->

- Double mealtime + correction dose with leaving the basal the same

- Modified basal bolus regimen (30% basal, 70% bolus)

- Add NPH once daily (weight + dose based, per below\*) if on daily
    prednisone

    - Prednisone 10 mg = 0.1 u/kg NPH

    - Prednisone 20 mg = 0.2 u/kg NPH up to 0.4 u/kg daily

    - \*lower dose if AKI, administer at the same time as prednisone
        dosing

<!-- -->

- On discharge, if steroids will be longstanding, increase home
    insulin regimen per inpatient requirements. If steroids will be
    tapered or discontinued soon after, either continue hospital regimen
    for remainder of steroid course or return to home regimen
    (hyperglycemia is better than hypoglycemia)

Additional Information

- At the VA, NPH is formulary

<!-- -->

- If a pt takes Lantus at home, this can be continued; otherwise, a
    PADR is needed.

- NPH’s duration of action is shorter than Lantus and, in most cases,
    should be dosed q12h. The conversion is done by taking total Lantus
    dose and dividing it two doses.

<!-- -->

- Tube feeds

<!-- -->

- Dose regular insulin q6h (not TID AC as they don’t have distinct
    “meals”)

- Consolidate for bolus feedings based on 24-hour insulin needs prior
    to discharge

<!-- -->

- Insulin pumps

<!-- -->

- If a patient has a pump and supplies, reasonably controlled BG, is
    willing and able to manage pump then s/he can keep the pump on.
    <u>This requires a Diabetes Consult.</u>

- Still order POC BG checks AC/HS for nurse to chart and fill out
    MedEx pump contract

Hypoglycemia – Will Bassett

Background

- Definition: BG \<70 mg/dL

<!-- -->

- Generally worse outcomes than hyperglycemia

<!-- -->

- Causes: infection, liver failure, iatrogenic (e.g. insulin not
    adjusted for AKI or being NPO)

- Symptoms vary from tremor, palpitations, delirium, dizziness, AMS,
    coma

Management

- Give PO carbohydrate load (15-20g oral glucose) if pt is alert and
    tolerates PO

- Give IV D50 if severe (\<50), or cannot take PO

- Repeat measurements after 15 minutes and treat again as needed

- Give glucagon 0.5-1mg SQ/IM if no IV access and impaired
    consciousness

<!-- -->

- Effect is transient and IV access should be obtained ASAP for
    glucose infusion

<!-- -->

- Do NOT hold basal insulin for T1DM: treat the low, then reduce dose
    if needed

Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) – Will Bassett, Matthew Gonzalez

Background

- Classically in type 1 diabetes but can also occur in
    insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes

- Definition: ↑ blood glucose (typically \>350) w/ high anion gap and
    ketones in blood/urine

- If glucose is significantly elevated but little to no ketones/anion
    gap present, you likely have HHS, which is typically associated with
    ↑ serum osm and BG \> 600

Evaluation

- Labs: BMP with anion gap (AG), CBC, phos, blood gas, serum osms, UA,
    consider beta-hydroxybutyrate

- Workup aimed at discovering the underlying cause (The "I’s"):

<!-- -->

- Infection/ Inflammation: CBC, CXR, UA/UCx, LFTs; consider BCx,
    lipase (pancreatitis). Note: Leukocytosis will be present in DKA,
    even if infection isn’t the precipitating factor

- Ischemia (MI, CVA, mesenteric ischemia): EKG, Troponin, CT(A) if
    clinical suspicion

- Intoxication - Ethanol (can cause ketosis with or without acidosis),
    cocaine, MDMA

- Impregnation - Beta HCG if appropriate

- Insulin-openia/Iatrogenic: steroids, SGLT2 inhibitors, other meds,
    insulin delivery failure (pump failure, insulin degraded by heat,
    etc.)

<!-- -->

- Remember to correct sodium for hyperglycemia (Na + 2.4 mEq \*
    (BG-100))

Management

- Initial monitoring: q2-4h BMPs (monitor K closely), q1h BG
    fingersticks

<!-- -->

- Can space less frequently once gap is closed x 2 and patient off
    insulin infusion

<!-- -->

- Ensure IV access

- Start IV fluids, insulin, and potassium as below

<!-- -->

- Start insulin gtt

- Start subcutaneous long-acting insulin as soon as insulin drip/IV
    insulin is started

    - Either start home long-acting (dose reduce as needed) or if
        insulin naïve, lantus 0.2-0.3u/kg/day

- Lactated ringers’ preferred fluid if no contraindication

- Dextrose should be added when BG \<200 (or clear liquid diet)

- Turn off insulin drip when anion gap is closed on two consecutive
    BMPs

<!-- -->

- Consult endocrinology early

- Management algorithm on next page (Diabetes Care. 2009 Jul; 32(7):
    1335–1343)

- Note: pts are usually deficient in total body potassium even if
    their serum potassium is high

Additional Information

- Pts on insulin drip can be admitted to stepdown (8MCE) with order
    set

- Pts can be admitted to stepdown on a subcutaneous insulin protocol
    with mild DKA with endocrinology guiding insulin management

- Avoid ordering C-peptide if concern for new type 1 diabetes, beta
    islet cells can be "stunned" with recent hyperglycemic states and
    may be falsely low

- SGLT2 inhibitors, are being prescribed much more often and can cause
    a euglycemic DKA, where acidosis and ketosis present but no elevated
    BG

Hypothyroidism – Griffin Bullock

Background

- Elevated TSH and low FT4 (primary hypothyroidism)

<!-- -->

- Hashimoto’s (autoimmune) thyroiditis, iodine deficiency, drugs
    (amiodarone, dopamine antagonists), adrenal insufficiency, thyroid
    hormone resistance (genetic), non-thyroidal illness (recovery
    phase), post-surgery or ablation for hyperthyroidism

<!-- -->

- Elevated TSH and normal FT4: subclinical hypothyroidism

- Low-Normal TSH, low FT4: central hypothyroidism, sick euthyroid

Presentation

- Often non-specific and vague: fatigue, cold intolerance, weight
    gain, constipation, dry skin, myalgia, edema menstrual
    irregularities, depression, mental dysfunction

- Goiter, bradycardia, diastolic hypertension, delayed relaxation
    following reflex testing

- Lab abnormalities: microcytic anemia, hypercholesterolemia,
    hyponatremia, elevated CK

Evaluation

- TSH: If elevated repeat TSH and obtain T4

- Lipid panel, CBC, BMP

Management

- Treatment required if ↓ T4, significantly ↑ TSH (\>10), or symptoms
    with any lab abnormality

- Titrate therapy to a normal TSH (unless central hypothyroidism, then
    target free T4 levels)

- Observation of asymptomatic pts with subclinical hypothyroidism
    (normal T4, mild ↑ TSH)

- Treatment is with formulation of T4 (full replacement is
    approximately 1.6 mcg/kg/day)

- Initial Dose:

<!-- -->

- Young/healthy patients: full anticipated dose

- Older patients or patients with CAD: 25-50 mcg daily

<!-- -->

- Increased doses required for: pregnancy, estrogen therapy, weight
    gain, PPI therapy, GI disorders (↓ absorption), ferrous sulfate
    therapy

Additional information

- Pts should take Levothyroxine alone, 1 hr prior to eating to ensure
    appropriate absorption

- Of note, missed doses can be taken along with the next dose

- Symptoms improve in 2-3 weeks. TSH steady state requires 6 weeks

- Dose can be titrated every 6 weeks based on TSH

- Pregnancy: Pregnancy causes lab changes due to differing levels
    thyroid binding globulin. Use tables based on trimester to interpret
    values

<!-- -->

- TPO antibody testing should be conducted if abnormal as this affects
    risk of complications

- Hypothyroid pts are at increased risk for preeclampsia, placental
    abruption, preterm labor/delivery

- Refer to endocrine for close monitoring and adjustment to avoid
    fetal complications

Thyroid Nodules – Terra Swanson

Background

- \~50% of adults will have a thyroid nodule on ultrasound

- Benign: goiter, cyst, inflammatory, Hashimoto’s, follicular adenoma
    (microadenoma)

- Malignant: follicular, papillary, medullary, anaplastic, metastatic,
    thyroid lymphoma

- Risk factors for malignancy: age \<30, head or neck radiation,
    family history of thyroid cancer

Evaluation

- Initial work-up after a nodule is found (either clinically or
    incidentally on imaging)

<!-- -->

- TSH, Free T4, Thyroid U/S

Management

- If Low TSH: Likely a hyperfunctioning nodule (benign in 95% of
    cases)

<!-- -->

- Order Iodine-123 or technetium-99m thyroid scan

    - If hyperfunctioning → measure T3/free T4 if ↑, treat for
        hyperthyroidism

    - If non-functioning → proceed as if TSH were normal

<!-- -->

- Normal or elevated TSH:

<!-- -->

- FNA indicated based on U/S findings listed below (determined by
    TI-RADS system)

    - Nodules \>1 cm that have high- or intermediate-suspicion pattern

    - Nodules \>1.5 cm that have low-suspicion pattern

    - Nodules \>2 cm that have very-low-suspicion pattern

- FNA cytology determines the plan of action:

    - Benign → periodic US monitoring at 12-24 months, then at
        increasing intervals

    - Indeterminate → repeat FNA in 3-12 months

    - Malignant → surgical referral

<!-- -->

- Nodules that do not meet FNA criteria, US findings determine the
    timing for follow-up imaging:

<!-- -->

- High suspicion: 6-12 months

- Low to intermediate suspicion: 12-24 months

- Nodules \>1 cm with very ↓ suspicion OR pure cyst: \>24 months if at
    all

<!-- -->

- Nodules \<1 cm with very ↓ suspicion OR pure cyst: no further
    imaging necessary

Hyperthyroidism – Griffin Bullock

Background

- Low TSH and High T4 and/or T3 (primary): Graves’ disease, Toxic
    goiter, TSH-producing adenoma, hyperemesis gravidarum, subacute
    granulomatous thyroiditis, amiodarone, radiation, excessive
    replacement, struma ovarii

- Low TSH/Normal T4 and T3: Subclinical hyperthyroidism, central
    hypothyroidism, non-thyroidal illness, recovery from
    hyperthyroidism, pregnancy (physiologic)

- Subclinical Hyperthyroidism: repeat testing to verify abnormality is
    not transient

Presentation

- Anxiety, emotional lability, heat intolerance, tremor, palpitations,
    increased appetite, unexplained weight loss, new onset atrial
    fibrillation, myopathy, menstrual disorder, exophthalmos,
    tachycardia, pretibial myxedema, hyperreflexia, lid lag, changes to
    hair or skin

Evaluation

- TSH, free T4, free T3 (only T3 or T4 may be elevated, though both
    often are)

<!-- -->

- Biotin affects assay, causes falsely ↓ TSH and falsely ↑ FT4/FT3

<!-- -->

- CBC: May have a normocytic anemia due to increased plasma volume

Management

- Thyrotropin antibodies (Graves-specific test, not sensitive)

- Radioiodine uptake scan if thyrotropin antibodies negative

- Treatment: methimazole, PTU, beta blockers, radioiodine ablation,
    surgery

- Pts should be referred to endocrinology for treatment plan based on
    work up

Thyroid Storm – Gaby Schroeder

Background

- Diagnosis is based on recognition of exaggerated signs/symptoms of
    thyrotoxicosis leading to multi-organ dysfunction in the setting of
    precipitating event

- Common Precipitants: Grave’s Disease, surgery, trauma, pregnancy,
    stress, infection, MI/PE, medication non-compliance, iodine loads

- Use Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS); available on MD Calc

<!-- -->

- \>45 highly suggestive

- 25-44 impending storm

- \<25 unlikely to represent storm

Management

- ENDOCRINE EMERGENCY - if suspected consult Endocrine ASAP

- Therapies directed towards thyroid gland

<!-- -->

- PTU: Preferred, 500-1000mg loading dose, followed by 250mg q4 -6
    hours (PO, rectal)

- Methimazole: q4-6 hours, dose varies (PO, rectal, IV)

<!-- -->

- Therapies directed toward decreasing T4 to T3 conversion

<!-- -->

- Propranolol (60-80mg PO q4)

- Hydrocortisone (300mg x1, 100mg q8) - treats high incidence of
    co-existing adrenal insufficiency

<!-- -->

- Cholestyramine 4g QID can be considered to reduce enteric
    recirculation

- Refractory Storm: plasmapheresis and plasma exchange

- Close hemodynamic monitoring, may need vasopressors (consider
    transfer to ICU)

Adrenal Insufficiency – Griffin Bullock

Background

- Differential: Primary (Adrenals) vs Secondary (Pituitary):

<!-- -->

- Exogenous steroid use (\>10 mg for \>3wks) undergoing severe
    physiologic stress or sudden discontinuation of steroid

- Autoimmune adrenal insufficiency

- Infection/Infiltration: tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, malignancy

- Hemorrhage (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome)

- Pituitary mass/tumor, infarct, infiltration, surgery

- Trauma

Presentation

- Generalized weakness, lightheaded, abdominal pain, nausea, weight
    loss, fatigue

- Lab Abnormalities: hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia

Evaluation

- Inpatient Setting

<!-- -->

- Draw AM cortisol and ACTH (ideally 8am) 0.25mg cosyntropin cortisol
    1 hour after

    - Cortisol level ≥18-20 rules out primary adrenal insufficiency
        (and most secondary)

<!-- -->

- Outpatient Setting

<!-- -->

- Draw AM cortisol level for screening (\>15 rules typically rules out
    adrenal insufficiency)

- ACTH stimulation for confirmation

Management

- Consult endocrine if ACTH stimulation test is abnormal

- Adrenal crisis (if concerned, treat first, test later)

<!-- -->

- BMP, glucose monitoring, ACTH level, serum cortisol

- Fluid resuscitation: NS or D5NS. Do not use hypotonic saline.

- Hydrocortisone 100mg x1 followed by 50mg q8h

Stress Dose Steroids – Griffin Bullock

Primary Options

- Dexamethasone 4 mg IV: does not affect cortisol assays, ideal if
    diagnosis uncertain

- Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV bolus then 50 mg q8h until stable: greater
    mineralocorticoid activity. Ideal if adrenal insufficiency
    known/confirmed or if hyperkalemic (K\>6.0)

When to Use

- Concern for adrenal crisis

- Patients with known adrenal insufficiency:

<!-- -->

- Minor Illness: ↑ dose x3 for 3 d or until clinically improved &
    acute stress resolved

<!-- -->

- Surgery: dependent on severity of operation

<!-- -->

- Minor (e.g. hernia repair): hydrocortisone 25 mg for 1 day

- Moderate (e.g. cholecystectomy): 50-75 mg day of surgery and post-op
    day 1

- Major (e.g. CABG): 100-150 mg daily 2-3 days (would consult
    endocrine in this setting)

- Trauma, critical illness, or unclear give stress dose

Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) – Chloe de Crecy

Background

- Elevated triglycerides (TG) on a <u>fasting</u> lipid panel

<!-- -->

- Normal: \<150 mg/dL

- Moderate HTG: 150-499 mg/dL

- Moderate to severe HTG: 500-999 mg/dL

- Severe HTG: \>1000 mg/dL

<!-- -->

- Nearly all patients with severe HTG have a genetic predisposition
    and an additional factor known to raise serum TGs (e.g. diabetes,
    alcohol abuse, oral estrogen therapy, hypothyroidism, nephrotic
    syndrome, propofol, ART)

- Risks of hypertriglyceridemia: pancreatitis (requires serum TG \>500
    mg/dL), ASCVD

- Signs: xanthomas, hepatosplenomegaly, lipemia retinalis, milky
    appearance of plasma

- Symptoms: short-term memory loss, abdominal pain, flushing with
    alcohol

Evaluation

- Order lipid panel for: usual outpatient screening, acute
    pancreatitis, cutaneous xanthomas, family members with familial HTG,
    monitoring HTG treatment

- Note: Sodium, glucose, amylase, LDL readings can be affected by HTG

- Consider sending A1c, Cr, TSH

- Assess medication list for secondary causes

Management

- HTG induced pancreatitis

<!-- -->

- If pt has hypocalcemia, lactic acidosis, or multi-organ dysfunction

    - Initiate plasmapheresis and monitor serum TG after each cycle
        until \<500

    - Severe dietary fat restriction (\<5%) until TG \<1000

- If none of the above and pt is hyperglycemic

    - Start insulin gtt, IVF, monitor q1h BG and q12h TG

    - Discontinue insulin when serum TG \<500

    - Severe dietary fat restriction (\<5%) until TG \<1000

- If none of the above and patient is euglycemic

    - Monitor q12h TG until \<500

    - Severe dietary fat restriction (\<5%) until TG \<1000

<!-- -->

- Long-term Management (once TG \<1000, otherwise decreased efficacy)

<!-- -->

- Pharmacologic: fibrates (most commonly fenofibrate), statins,
    niacin, omega-3 fatty acids

- Nonpharmacologic: discontinue alcohol use, dietary fat and sugar
    restriction (target fat intake at \<10% of calorie intake), exercise

Adrenal Incidentalomas – Matthew Gonzalez

Background

- Adrenal mass \>1cm, discovered by chance on radiographic imaging

- Less than 1% are malignant

- Supportive of benign: \<4 cm in size, smooth borders, homogenous
    appearance, \<10 HU (Hounsfield units), rapid contrast washout (on
    "adrenal phase" imaging)

- Supportive of malignancy: \>4 cm in size, irregular borders, \> 20
    HU on unenhanced CT, delayed contrast washout, tumor calcifications,
    increase in size over time, presence in young pts and hx cancer

    Evaluation

- All incidentalomas should be screened for pheochromocytoma (\~3%
    incidence) before operative intervention (24-hour urine fractionated
    metanephrines, catecholamines, plasma fractionated metanephrines)

- Cortisol secreting adenoma (\~6% incidence) causing Cushing's
    syndrome: baseline serum DHEAS, low dose (1mg) overnight
    dexamethasone suppression test

- Aldosterone secreting adenoma (\<1% incidence) causing
    hyperaldosteronism: if hypertensive (HTN) or hypokalemic order
    plasma aldosterone and renin, confirmatory testing with sodium
    loading (oral vs IV) and 24-hour urine aldosterone, sodium, and
    creatinine

    Management

- If benign appearing and not hormone producing: interval imaging in
    \~1 year, and repeat hormone work up

- Unilateral adrenal incidentaloma

<!-- -->

- If progression free (stable size, and not hormone producing) can
    consider monitoring cessation after 4 years

<!-- -->

- Pheochromocytomas should undergo surgical evaluation for removal

<!-- -->

- Alpha blockade (phenoxybenzamine) + propranolol prior to resection
    to avoid HTN crisis

<!-- -->

- Aldosteronoma: should undergo surgical evaluation for definitive
    treatment; if unable to undergo surgery can use mineralocorticoid
    antagonist (e.g. spironolactone)

- Cortisoloma: if clinically significant should undergo surgical
    removal, will need perioperative glucocorticoid administration to
    avoid iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency

- Macroadenomas (masses \>4 cm) are usually malignant and should be
    considered for surgical resection due to higher risk of carcinoma

- Bilateral adrenal incidentalomas

<!-- -->

- Surgical evaluation + will need adrenal venous sampling to confirm
    laterality in hormone producing tumors.

Additional information

- Not all hyperaldosterone states will have both HTN and hypokalemia

- Subclinical Cushing's syndrome may be present based on initial
    dexamethasone suppression test, perform additional testing to
    determine if clinically significant
