# Central Diabetes Insipidus

Chloe de Crecy

---
## Definition
-	Lack of antidiuretic hormone results in free water excreted at kidneys 

## Etiology 
-	Idiopathic, autoimmune, tumors (primary or secondary), infiltrative (Langerhans cell histiocytosis), congenital, trauma, surgery, severe shock/ischemia 

## Presentation 
-	Polyuria, nocturia, polydipsia 
-	Elevated Na and osmolality, only if impaired thirst. Can be normal due to compensatory thirst
-	Decreased bone mineral density (unclear pathophysiology) 

## Evaluation 
-	1. Confirm polyuria w/ low Uosm (DDx: psychogenic polydipsia, central DI, nephrogenic DI)
-	2. Water restriction. If urine concentrates (Uosm>700), it is primary polydipsia not DI.
-	3. Desmopressin trial (after Na >145) to differentiate between nephrogenic vs central.  Central DI responds to desmopressin.
-	4. MRI to investigate cause  

## Management 
-	Desmopressin (ADH analog) - PO, IV forms. Given at bedtime. 
-	Goal: reduce nocturia to improve sleep 
-	Risk: hyponatremia
