# Outpatient Diabetes Management

Matthew Lu

## Background
-	Type I Diabetes - insulin deficiency (GAD65, IA2, ZnT8 antibodies positive, Insulin and C-peptide inappropriately low)
-	Type II Diabetes - insulin resistance (generally associated with obesity)
-	Classification by HgA1c: Pre-diabetes: 5.7 to 6.4%; Diabetes: >= 6.5

## Management:
-	Lifestyle changes:
    -	Exercise 175 minutes weekly
    -	Caloric restriction for weight loss of 10%
        -	Low carb or Mediterranean diet, reduce normal portions by 10-20%, limit sugary drinks, drink large glass of water before meals
-	BP Goal generally < 130/80
    -	ACE-inhibitor is first-line anti-hypertensive
-	Manage complications of diabetes
    -	Increased cardiovascular risk (2-4x risk of MI, CVA or death)
        -	High intensity statin if clinical ASCVD present
        -	Moderate intensity statin if age > 40 or with ASCVD risk factors (LDL >100, HTN, smoking, FHx of CVD, CKD)
        -	Consider aspirin if ASCVD > 10% (balanced against bleeding risk)
        -	Smoking cessation
        -	Baseline ECG at diagnosis
    -	Retinopathy – annual retinal exams
    -	Peripheral Neuropathy – annual foot exams, can use gabapentin if present
    -	Autonomic Neuropathy – ED, orthostatic hypotension, gastroparesis
    -	Nephropathy – annual creatinine and urine microalbumin (albumin/creatinine ratio) - need repeat measurements 3mo apart to confirm albuminuria
        -	Normal: < 30mg/g
        -	Moderate albuminuria: 30-300 mg/g (consider starting ACE-I)
        -	Severe albuminuria: > 300 mg/g i(should be on ACE-I)
        -	If persistent despite ACE-I, start SGLT2 inhibitor (if GFR allows)
        -	If persistent despite SLGT2 inhibitor, start finerenone
        -	Consider involving nephrology 
-	Glycemic goals:
    -	Fasting glucose 80-130 mg/dL, postprandial (90-120 min after meal) < 180mg/dL
    -	A1c goal: generally < 7%, < 7.5% for 65 yrs, < 8% for poor health or life expectancy < 10 yrs 
-	Medications for glycemic control
    -	For pre-diabetes, encourage lifestyle management and consider starting metformin
    -	If initial HgA1c < 9%
        -	1st agent: metformin (usually decreases HgA1c by 1-2%) – start at 500mg daily and increase by 500mg every 1-2 weeks if no GI side effects up to goal 2000mg daily
            -	If eGFR < 45, then half dose
            -	If eGFR < 30, then discontinue
        -	2nd agent (if HgA1c still not at goal within 3 months):
            -	GLP-1 agonist generally preferred (best weight loss benefit, usually decreases HgA1c by 1%)
            -	SGLT2 inhibitor preferred if pt has HF or DM nephropathy (usually decreases HgA1c by 1%)
            -	Consider sulfonylurea if pt on HD
        -	3rd agent (if HgA1c still not at goal after additional 3 months)
            -	GLP-1 agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor (whichever was not started as second agent)
    -	If initial HgA1c > 9%
        -	Start metformin AND GLP-1/DDP4-I OR insulin
-	How to initiate insulin
    -	Start with long-acting insulin nightly (10 units or 0.1 units/kg/d)
        -	Check fasting glucose daily and increase insulin by 2 units q 2-3 days until fasting glucose within goal (80-130mg/dL)
        -	If hypoglycemia occurs, decrease insulin by 4 units or 10% (whichever is greater)
    -	If A1c > 7% after 3mo, add mealtime insulin
        -	Check post-prandial glucose and start with 4 units short acting insulin at meals where post-prandial glucose > 180. Adjust by 2 units q 3 days until post-prandial glucose < 180. 
-	When HgA1c < 6.5% consider de-escalating medications
-	Other medication class options: sulfonylureas, DDP4-I, thiazolidinediones
