# Outpatient Medical Weight Loss

Liana Mosley

---

## Background 	
- 74% of US adults are overweight/obese
- Target weight loss of 5-7% body weight for prevention of co-morbidities
- In general, encourage lifestyle modifications (dietary interventions, exercise) first
    - See Obesity/Nutrition under Outpt Medicine

## Management
- Consider referral to medical weight loss: BMI ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 with with ≥ 1 co-morbidity
- Referral to surgical weight loss: BMI ≥ 35 or ≥ 30 with with ≥ 1 co-morbidity
