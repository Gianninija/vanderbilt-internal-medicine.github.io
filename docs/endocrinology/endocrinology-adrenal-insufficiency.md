# Adrenal Insufficiency 

Griffin Bullock

## Background
-	Differential: Primary (Adrenals) vs Secondary (Pituitary):
    -	Exogenous steroid use (>10mg for >3wks) undergoing severe physiologic stress or sudden discontinuation of steroid
    -	Autoimmune adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s)
    -	Infection/Infiltration: tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, malignancy
    -	Hemorrhage (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome)
    -	Pituitary mass/tumor, infarct, infiltration, surgery
    -	Trauma

## Presentation
-	Generalized weakness, lightheaded, abdominal pain, nausea, weight loss, fatigue
-	Lab Abnormalities: hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia

## Evaluation
-	Inpt Setting
    -	Draw AM cortisol and ACTH (ideally 8am)  0.25mg cosyntropin  cortisol 1h after
        -	Cortisol level ≥18-20 rules out primary adrenal insufficiency (and most secondary)
-	Outpt Setting
    -	Draw AM cortisol level for screening (>15 rules typically rules out adrenal insufficiency)
    -	ACTH stimulation for confirmation

## Management
-	Consult endocrine if ACTH stimulation test is abnormal
-	Outpt: physiologic replacement doses usually with hydrocortisone (dosed 8am and ~2-4pm to mimic physiology). Can be dosed based on BSA or estimation based on weight. Ranges from ~20-40mg total daily (ex. 15mg AM, 10mg PM). Pt to increase if acute illness. 
-	Adrenal crisis (if concerned, treat first, test later)
    -	BMP, glucose monitoring, ACTH level, serum cortisol
    -	Fluid resuscitation: NS or D5NS. Do not use hypotonic saline.
    -	Hydrocortisone 100mg x1 followed by 50mg q8h
