## Primary Options
-	Dexamethasone 4mg IV: does not affect cortisol assays, ideal if diagnosis uncertain
-	Hydrocortisone 100mg IV bolus then 50mg q8h until stable: greater mineralocorticoid activity. Ideal if adrenal insufficiency known/confirmed or if hyperkalemic (K>6.0)

## When to Use
-	Concern for adrenal crisis
-	Pts with known adrenal insufficiency:
    -	Minor Illness: â†‘ dose x3 for 3 d or until clinically improved & acute stress resolved
-	Surgery: dependent on severity of operation
    -	Minor (e.g. hernia repair): hydrocortisone 25mg for 1 day
    -	Moderate (e.g. cholecystectomy): 50-75mg day of surgery and post-op day 1
    -	Major (e.g. CABG): 100-150mg daily 2-3 days (would consult endocrine)
- Trauma, critical illness, or unclear give stress dose
