# Thyroid Nodules

## Background
-	~50% of adults will have a thyroid nodule on ultrasound
-	Benign: goiter, cyst, inflammatory, Hashimoto’s, follicular adenoma (microadenoma)
-	Malignant: follicular, papillary, medullary, anaplastic, metastatic, thyroid lymphoma
-	Risk factors for malignancy: age <30, head or neck radiation, family history of thyroid cancer

## Evaluation
-	Initial work-up after a nodule is found (either clinically or incidentally on imaging)
    -	TSH, Free T4, Thyroid U/S

## Management
-	If Low TSH: Likely a hyperfunctioning nodule (benign in 95% of cases)
    -	Order Iodine-123 or technetium-99m thyroid scan
        -	If hyperfunctioning → measure T3/free T4 if ↑, treat for hyperthyroidism
        -	If non-functioning → proceed as if TSH were normal
-	Normal or elevated TSH:
    -	FNA indicated based on U/S findings listed below (determined by TI-RADS system)
        -	Nodules >1cm that have high- or intermediate-suspicion pattern
        -	Nodules >1.5cm that have low-suspicion pattern
        -	Nodules >2cm that have very-low-suspicion pattern
    -	FNA cytology determines the plan of action:
        -	Benign → periodic US monitoring at 12-24mo, then at increasing intervals
        -	Indeterminate → repeat FNA in 3-12 months
        -	Malignant → surgical referral
-	Nodules that do not meet FNA criteria, US findings determine the timing for follow-up imaging:
    -	High suspicion: 6-12mo
    -	Low to intermediate suspicion: 12-24mo
    -	Nodules >1cm with very ↓ suspicion OR pure cyst:  >24mo if at all
    -	Nodules <1cm with very ↓ suspicion OR pure cyst: no further imaging necessary
