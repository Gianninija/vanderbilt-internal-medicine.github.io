# Hypothyroidism

Griffin Bullock

## Background
-	Elevated TSH and low FT4 (primary hypothyroidism)
    -	Hashimoto’s (autoimmune) thyroiditis, iodine deficiency, drugs (amiodarone, dopamine antagonists), adrenal insufficiency, thyroid hormone resistance (genetic), non-thyroidal illness (recovery phase), post-surgery or ablation for hyperthyroidism
-	Elevated TSH and normal FT4: subclinical hypothyroidism
-	Low-Normal TSH, low FT4: central hypothyroidism, sick euthyroid

## Presentation
-	Often non-specific and vague: fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, constipation, dry skin, myalgia, edema, menstrual irregularities, depression, mental dysfunction
-	Goiter, bradycardia, diastolic hypertension, delayed relaxation following reflex testing
-	Lab abnormalities: microcytic anemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyponatremia, elevated CK

## Evaluation
-	TSH: If elevated repeat TSH and obtain T4
-	Lipid panel, CBC, BMP

## Management
-	Treatment required if ↓ T4, significantly ↑ TSH (>10), or symptoms with any lab abnormality
-	Titrate therapy to a normal TSH (unless central hypothyroidism, then target free T4 levels) 
-	Observation of asymptomatic pts with subclinical hypothyroidism (normal T4, mild ↑ TSH) 
-	Treatment is with formulation of T4 (full replacement is approximately 1.6 mcg/kg/day) 
-	Initial Dose:
    -	Young/healthy pts: full anticipated dose
    -	Older pts or pts with CAD, atrial fibrillation: 25-50 mcg daily
-	Increased doses required for: pregnancy, estrogen therapy, weight gain, PPI therapy, GI disorders (↓ absorption), ferrous sulfate therapy
-	Risks of overtreatment: cardiac effects, increase risk of osteoporosis

## Additional information
-	Pts should take Levothyroxine alone, 1h prior to eating to ensure appropriate absorption. Calcium, iron, PPIs interfere the most with absorption.
-	Of note, missed doses can be taken along with the next dose.
-	Symptoms improve in 2-3 weeks. TSH steady state requires 6 weeks.
-	Dose can be titrated every 6 weeks based on TSH.
-	Pregnancy: Pregnancy causes lab changes due to differing levels thyroid binding globulin. Use tables based on trimester to interpret values.
    -	TPO antibody testing should be conducted, as if abnormal this affects risk of complications
    -	Hypothyroid pts are at increased risk for preeclampsia, placental abruption, preterm labor/delivery
    -	Refer to endocrine for close monitoring and adjustment to avoid fetal complications
