# Severe Hypertriglyceridemia

Chloe de Crecy

---

## Background
-	Elevated triglycerides (TG) on a fasting lipid panel
    -	Normal: <150 mg/dL
    -	Moderate HTG: 150-499 mg/dL
    -	Moderate to severe HTG: 500-999 mg/dL
    -	Severe HTG: >1000 mg/dL
-	Nearly all pts with severe HTG have a genetic predisposition + additional risk factor (e.g. DM, alcohol abuse, oral estrogen, hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, propofol, ART)
-	Risks of hypertriglyceridemia: pancreatitis (requires serum TG >500 mg/dL), ASCVD
-	Signs: xanthomas, hepatosplenomegaly, lipemia retinalis, milky appearance of plasma
-	Sxs: short-term memory loss, abdominal pain, flushing with ETOH

## Evaluation
-	Lipid panel: usual outpt screening, acute pancreatitis, cutaneous xanthomas, familial HTG, monitoring HTG treatment
-	Note: Na, glucose, amylase, LDL readings can be affected by HTG
-	Consider sending A1c, Cr, TSH
-	Assess medication list for secondary causes

## Management
-	HTG induced pancreatitis
    -	If pt has hypocalcemia, lactic acidosis, or multi-organ dysfunction
        -	Initiate plasmapheresis and monitor serum TG after each cycle until <500
        -	Severe dietary fat restriction (<5%) until TG <1000
    -	If none of the above and pt is hyperglycemic
        -	Start insulin gtt, IVF, monitor q1h BG and q12h TG
        -	Discontinue insulin when serum TG <500
        -	Severe dietary fat restriction (<5%) until TG <1000
    -	If none of the above and pt is euglycemic
        -	Start insulin gtt + dextrose, Monitor q12h TG until <500
        -	Severe dietary fat restriction (<5%) until TG <1000
-	Long-term Management (once TG <1000, otherwise decreased efficacy)
    -	Pharmacologic: fibrates (most commonly fenofibrate), statins, niacin, omega-3 fatty acids
    -	Nonpharmacologic: discontinue ETOH use, dietary fat and sugar restriction (target fat intake at <10% of calorie intake), exercise
