# Osteoporosis

Claire Lo

---
## Background 	
-	Definition: decreased bone mass leading to increased risk of fracture 
-	Differential: malignancy (e.g., multiple myeloma), elder abuse (e.g., spiral fractures of long bones), hyperparathyroidism, Paget’s disease

## Evaluation
-	Interpretation of DEXA Score
    -	Osteoporosis:  T score ≦ -2.5
    -	Osteopenia: -1.0 > T score > -2.5
    -	Normal bone mineral density: T score  -1.0
-	Interpretation of FRAX (Fracture Risk Assessment Tool):
    -	10-year risk of major osteoporotic fracture (Google “FRAX tool.”)

## Pharmacologic Management
-	Indications:  T score ≦ -2.5 (osteoporosis) OR -1.0 > T score > -2.5 with FRAX>3% for hip fracture 
-	First line: oral bisphosphonates (alendronate 10mg qd, at least 30min before food) 
-	If eGFR<30: refer to endocrinology for IV zoledronic acid or IV denosumab 
-	If severe (T score< -3.0): consider anabolic (e.g., teriparatide) as first line agent

## Additional Information
-	There is currently no recommendation to screen men for osteoporosis.
