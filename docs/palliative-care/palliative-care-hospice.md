## VA Specifics for Hospice:
-	Main difference compared to VUMC is pt is allowed concurrent care
    -	This means vets can continue to receive some treatments for the primary condition (e.g. palliative radiation or chemotherapy) and still receive hospice services
-	Additionally, all veterans that go on hospice should have any needed nursing home stay (at a contracted SNF) covered by the VA regardless of service connection
-	VA Palliative Care team will help with these referrals
-	One (1) F Status at the VA
    -	Designates “treating specialty” as NA-HOSPICE. Reduces costs for families, helps quality metrics. Use this if pt qualifies and agrees to hospice care
    -	Write Delayed Transfer Orders: Admit to NA-HOSPICE and Specialty as “Hospice for Acute Care”
    -	Write a nursing text order to “Change Pt to 1-F Status”
