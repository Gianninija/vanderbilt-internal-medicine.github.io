# Sickle Cell Crisis

Michael J. Neuss

---

## Background
-	Present with severe pain in bone, joints, chest, abdomen
-	Causes: (HIDISC) Hypoxia, Ischemia, Dehydration, Infection, Stress, Cold 
-	Can’t miss:
    -	Acute chest: new infiltrate on CXR + another clinical symptom (fever, chest pain, hypoxia). Consult Benign Hematology immediately. Do not wait until the next day.
    -	PE (ACS less likely in these pts), avascular necrosis of hip, priapism, stroke

## Evaluation
-	Labs: ↑ LDH, Hgb/Hct (low; check versus baseline), retic, smear, WBC
-	If febrile: UA + blood cultures 
-	Hgb S level only in certain circumstances (e.g. guides treatment in acute chest)
-	Imaging: CXR, MRI for hip pain, abdominal U/S or CT abdomen 
-	Maintain active type and cross given probability of alloimmunization 

## Management
-	General
    -	Look for a care coordination yellow note in the Summary Tab
        -	Heme clinic will have specific management preferences for individual pts
    -	Maintain hydration, IVF at 150-200 cc/hr (if no contraindication)
    -	Oxygen: goal sat ~95% (higher O2 goal will help to prevent further sickling)
    -	Continue folic acid 1 mg QD
    -	Continue hydroxyurea if uncomplicated pain crisis
        -	Hold if counts suppressed or concern for infection
    -	If in the MICU: consider discussion for plasma exchange (if Hgb SS or SC or S-Thal)
    -	Transfuse: Simple transfusion if Hgb lower than baseline and/or complications
        -	Avoid transfusions when able, given risk of antibody formation
-	Pain
    -	Will generally require opiates, often initiation of PCA
    -	All SS pts should have pain plans. Inpt pain plans are in the problem list under sickle cell disease or in the care coordination section of Epic
    -	Outpt plans (to which you will transition pts back prior to discharge) are not standardized in location, but can be under Media (with a pain contract) or found in notes 
-	Acute chest:
    -	Consult Hematology at time of admission
    -	Obtain HbS level
    -	Avoid dehydration. Consider LR @ 125-200 cc/hr but caution with overhydration (may worsen pulmonary edema)
    -	Incentive spirometry: atelectasis and hypoxia drive V/Q mismatching and further sickling
    -	Transfuse hgb to goal of 10 (do not exceed to avoid hyperviscosity)
    -	Pain control per pain plan
    -	Consider Abx for CAP (vs HAP if risk factors)
    -	Plasma exchange for moderate-severe cases (driven by hematology)
