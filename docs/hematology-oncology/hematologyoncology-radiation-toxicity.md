# Radiation Toxicity

Jayden Gracie

---

### Radiation pneumonitis
-	6 weeks to 6 months after RT to chest
-	Presents like pneumonia with cough and SOB, so need to rule out PNA
-	Imaging: chest X-ray or CT
-	Treatment: steroids

### Radiation dermatitis
-	Onset during or shortly after treatment
-	Variable: redness, dry desquamation (peeling, dry skin), or wet desquamation (blistering and oozing)
-	Treatment
    -	Aquaphor or Aquaphor + lidocaine
    -	Lidocaine can sometimes burn over wet desquamation. For wet desquamation (especially if looks potentially infected), start on Silvadene until it dries up. Then add non-adhesive barrier dressings.
    -	Topical corticosteroids are helpful for itching (e.g. OTC hydrocortisone)
    -	Sitz baths and peri bottles useful for perineal skin reaction after RT to chest. 

### Mucositis
-	Treatment
    -	Salt water and baking soda rinses to help clear debris out of mouth.
    -	Magic mouthwash, swish and spit if mouth only (as many times a day as they want) or swish and swallow up to every 4h. Can give viscous lidocaine if pt prefers.
    -	For weight loss >15lbs during treatments: consider G-tube but want to avoid if possible since slows swallowing function recovery
    -	Can try soft or liquid diet, protein drinks
    -	For esophagitis, can order carafate liquid formulation (to coat esophagus). May require prior auth, indication is radiation esophagitis. Consider PPI  

### Secretions and mouth dryness
-	Glycopyrrolate or Mucinex can help with thick secretions but can be drying.
-	Baking soda and salt, sugarless gum
-	Can try Levsin, scopolamine patches. 

### Nausea
-	Evaluate for and treat constipation, secretions, and acid reflux
-	Zofran is 1st line followed by compazine

### Pain Flares
-	Present with treatment of bony mets in up to 40% of pts. Spikes in pain usually occur either toward the end of treatment or a few days after due to inflammation.
-	Treat with steroid taper per Rad-Onc

### Radiation-associated dysuria
-	Presents with UTI-like symptoms during treatment.
-	Rule out UTI
-	Treatment: Hydration. Can try NSAIDs and phenazopyridine (note urine color change). Consider short steroid course next.

### Bowel toxicity
-	Upper: nausea/vomiting, loose/watery stools. 
-	Lower: loose/watery stools, cramping, tenesmus, urgency
-	Treatment: Try low residue diet, anti-diarrheal agents (Imodium, Lomotil), sucralfate, protozoa/5-ASA enemas
-	Consider cessation or break of RT
