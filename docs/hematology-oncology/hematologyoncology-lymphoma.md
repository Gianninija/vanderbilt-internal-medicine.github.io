# Lymphoma

Danielle Fishman

---

## Background
-	Classically characterized by lymphadenopathy and constitutional “B” symptoms: fevers, drenching night sweats and weight loss
-	Hodgkin (10%): superficial, nodal disease with orderly spread
    -	Bimodal distribution: 15-35 years and >50 years; M>F
    -	CD15+, CD30+ (Reed Sternberg cells “owl eyes”)
    -	Associated with EBV in immunocompromised pt
-	Non-Hodgkin (90%): diffuse, nodal and extranodal disease with noncontiguous spread
    -	Average 65 years, M>F, 85-90% B-cell
    -	Associated with immunodeficiency (HIV, post-transplant), autoimmune disease, infection (EBV, HTLV-1, H pylori, HCV, Borrelia, C psittacosis, Coxiella)

## General Evaluation
-	History: B symptoms, pruritus (10-15% of pt with HL), history of radiation 
-	Physical Exam
    -	Evaluate head and neck, tonsils, axilla, testes, liver, spleen
    -	Lymphadenopathy: painless, firm, fixed, >1cm
-	Lab tests:
    -	CBC, CMP, LDH, uric acid, phosphorus
    -	Consider HBV, HCV,  HIV, EBV, Quant gold, treponemal Ab, ANA
-	Imaging:
    -	CT chest, abdomen, pelvis
    -	Most will eventually need PET-CT. MRI brain if neuro symptoms
-	Consider LP for NHL with high risk of CNS involvement or presence of neurological symptoms
    -	Risk factors: Burkitt, lymphoblastic, testicular involvement, double/triple hit
    -	Multiple LPs may be required to diagnose CNS lymphoma
-	Diagnosis requires tissue
    -	Excisional lymph node biopsy: Surgical Oncology consult
    -	Core biopsy: CT guided procedure consult
    -	Of note, steroids may impact value of biopsy results
-	Lugano Classification: staging of lymphoma
    -	One - 1 LN region or single extra lymphatic organ/site without nodal involvement
    -	Two - >2 LN regions, same side of diaphragm
    -	Three - LN regions on both sides of diaphragm
    -	Four - Disseminated disease w/ 1+ extralymphatic organ
-	Hodgkin: 
    -	IPS negative prognostic calculator: albumin <4, hemoglobin <10.5, male, stage IV disease,  age>45, WBC count> 15K, lymphocyte <8% of WBC count
-	Non-Hodgkin: 
    -	Good prognosis: Follicular, marginal zone, mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome 
    -	Poor prognosis: DLBCL – can arise from low grade lymphoma (Richter transformation); Double/Triple hit: bcl-2, bcl-6, or myc aberrations; mantle cell, Burkitt, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and anaplastic large cell lymphoma  

## General Management:
-	ECG and TTE to establish pre-chemotherapy cardiac function—many chemo regimens with anthracyclines
-	Daily labs: CBC, TLS, LDH 
-	TLS prophylaxis: mIVF, allopurinol
