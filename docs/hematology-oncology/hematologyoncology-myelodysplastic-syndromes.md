# Myelodysplastic Syndromes

## Background
-	MDS is a malignant clonal myeloid disorder resulting in ineffective (dysplastic) hematopoiesis leading to peripheral cytopenias and a risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
-	Usually idiopathic, a disease of the elderly (median onset at age 70)
-	The WHO has several classification schemes for MDS
    -	Most important for classification is the percent of blasts in the bone marrow
    -	Note >20% blasts in marrow = AML. Thus MDS and AML are on a continuum

## Presentation
-	50% asymptomatic; symptoms can include nonspecific but gradual fatigue, weakness
-	Dysplastic cells do not work properly à infections and bleeding are more likely
-	Macrocytic anemia is most common finding; followed by bicytopenia or pancytopenia  
-	Isolated neutropenia or thrombocytopenia are unusual but possible
-	Ask about secondary causes
    -	Exposure to chemicals (benzene, crude oil/gasoline industry, cigarette smoke), chemotherapy, radiation
    -	Medications, alcohol use, chronic infections (HIV)

## Evaluation
-	Goal is to rule out reversible causes of dysplasia and cytopenias 
-	CBC w/differential, peripheral smear, B12, folate, HIV
    -	Consider copper and zinc 
-	Dysplastic changes on peripheral smear: hypogranulated/hyposegmented neutrophils, hypogranulated platelets and macrocytosis of RBCs
    -	Circulating myeloblasts can be seen
-	Final diagnosis made by bone marrow biopsy 

## Management
-	Molecular characteristics define the “risk” of the disease and dictates treatments
-	Prognostic scoring tools: revised international prognostic staging system (R-IPSS) 
-	Management general paradigm
    -	Asymptomatic: with low-risk disease: monitoring
    -	Low-risk disease + symptoms due to anemia only: transfusions, erythrocyte stimulating agents, and treatment with Luspatercept
    -	MDS with isolated del(5q): treated with lenalidomide
    -	High-risk pts:  treated with hypomethylating agents
    -	Only curative intervention: hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT)
