# Transfusion Medicine

- For emergent transfusions, call the blood bank (see directory)
- RNs on 10T and 11N can follow transfusion protocols for pRBCs and plts – enter as a “Nursing Communication” or as part of the Hematology/Oncology Admission Order set. 
-	At VUMC, all special processing of blood products (such as irradiation) will be decided by blood bank based on special considerations listed in order set. Examples include: stem cell transplant, hematologic malignancy, or thalassemia
-	Pts with frequent transfusions (e.g. sickle cell hemoglobinopathy) should have an “RBC Extended Phenotype” ordered (once) for minor RBC antigens to avoid immunization and antibody development to these proteins
-	You may ask the VUMC hematology lab to email you pictures of the peripheral smear
- VA: Orders Tab – Blood Bank Orders – follow prompts to select appropriate product. Must order both the blood product AND the transfusion order (“Transfuse blood”)
    - You need to specify all special processing such as irradiation
    - To order “Type & Screen” as a lab, you must go to Blood Bank Orders
    - Type & Screen and Transfusion results are under the Blood tab in Results

## Red Blood Cell Transfusion
-	Volume 200-300 mL per unit prbc
-	In general, 1 unit of packed RBCs increases Hgb by 1g/dL and HCT by ~3%
-	Assessment of the post-transfusion Hgb can be performed 15 min following transfusion, but ideally 1 hour after completion

### Indications:
-	Hgb <9-10 g/dL: Acute coronary syndrome
-	Hgb <8 g/dL or Hct <25: Bone marrow failure or receiving antineoplastic therapy
    -	Also sometimes used in pts with pre-existing CAD
-	Hgb <7 g/dL or Hct <21: ICU, GI Bleeding, oncology pt on treatment

## Platelets Transfusion
-	Indications for transfusion
    -	<11 k/µL: all pts, reduce risk of spontaneous hemorrhage (use on BMT, Brittingham)
    -	<50 k/µL: active bleeding, scheduled to undergo select invasive procedure
    -	<100 k/µL: CNS hemorrhage, intrathecal catheter
        -	This is also the threshold used for most neurosurgical procedures

## Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and Cryoprecipitate (Cryo)
Cryoprecipitate: FFP enriched for von Willebrand factor, factor VIII, factor XIII, and fibrinogen 

FFP
-	Once thawed, must be used in 24 hrs (due to decline in labile coagulation factors) 
-	Must be ABO compatible but not crossmatched or Rh typing
-	Only administer FFP if INR ≥1.7 (FFP will not fix an INR < 1.7)

Indications for transfusion
-	Bleeding:
    -	FFP If INR >1.7
    -	Cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen <100.
-	DIC:
    -	Fibrinogen <100: Transfuse 5 – 10 units cryoprecipitate and repeat fibrinogen. If bleeding, consider raising transfusion threshold of cryoprecipitate to fibrinogen <150
    -	For elevated INR, consider FFP transfusion. Thresholds for doing this vary by attending
-	Cirrhosis:
    -	General concept: PT/INR, aPTT are unreliable markers for bleeding. Fibrinogen ≤100 – 120 or thromboelastography are better surrogates for bleeding risk
    -	Transfuse fibrinogen ≤100 – 120 if the pt is actively bleeding or about to undergo a procedure or surgery other than paracentesis
    -	Transfuse FFP based on hepatology team preference (generally few indications for FFP)

## Transfusion Premedication and Reactions
-	If you are concerned about a serious transfusion reaction, pause the transfusion and contact the blood bank ASAP
-	Order the transfusion reaction blood testing in Epic. You will send a CBC, the bag of blood products, and the completed form to the blood bank for analysis

Premedication:
-	Only if history of severe reaction
    -	Diphenhydramine 25-50mg IV
    -	Acetaminophen 650 mg PO
    -	Meperidine 25-50 mg IV (optional for chills)
    -	Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV (optional, for severe reactions or reactions despite acetaminophen and diphenhydramine)
