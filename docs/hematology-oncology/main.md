# Anemia

Margaret Wheless

---

## Presentation

- Symptoms:
  - Fatigue/malaise, dyspnea on exertion, angina (if history of CAD)
- Signs:
    - Pallor, tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, purpura, glossitis,
    koilonychia (in IDA)
    - Jaundice (if hemolysis)
    - Splenomegaly: suggests extramedullary hematopoiesis or sequestration
    - Neurologic symptoms: suggests B12 deficiency

## Evaluation

- CBC w/diff, reticulocyte count, peripheral blood smear, Iron studies
    (TIBC, Ferritin)
- RI > 2%: blood loss vs hemolysis; see below
    - Hemolysis labs: Bilirubin, LDH, haptoglobin
- RI < 2%: hypoproliferative stratify based on RBC size
    - Microcytic (<80) vs. Normocytic (80-100) vs. Macrocytic (>100)

## Reticulocyte Index >2%

### Background

- Etiology: Consumption vs Blood loss
- Loss: acute bleed vs iatrogenic from labs
- Hemolysis: Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), autoimmune
    hemolytic anemia (AIHA), intrinsic RBC defects

### Evaluation

- LDH, ↑indirect bilirubin, ↓haptoglobin, PT/PTT
- Peripheral blood smear: evaluated for schistocytes, bite cells, spur
    cells, spherocytes, etc.
- Direct antiglobulin test (DAT) to evaluate for autoimmune hemolytic
    anemia

### Extrinsic RBC causes:

- If schistocytes ± thrombocytopenia = MAHA: TTP, DIC, HUS, HELLP,
    mechanical valves, malignant HTN, cocaine, scleroderma renal crisis
- If DAT positive = AIHA

### Intrinsic RBC causes:

- Sickle cell disease: chronic hemolysis + splenic sequestration
    crisis where RI is↑ vs aplastic crisis where RI is↓ (see sickle cell
    section)
- Hereditary spherocytosis
- Hereditary elliptocytosis
- PNH
- G6PD: bite cells, Heinz bodies
    - Usually precipitated by drugs: nitrofurantoin, dapsone,
    sulfonamides, rasburicase, primaquine

## Management

- MAHA
- DIC: sepsis, malignancy, pregnancy
    - Treat underlying cause
    - If active bleeding: FFP, cryoprecipitate (to keep
        fibrinogen\>100) and platelets
- TTP: Order ADAMTS13 (prior to plasma transfusion or exchange)
    - If concern for TTP you should immediately consult Heme and
        Nephrology
- HUS: + shiga toxin, AKI, diarrhea
- AIHA:
    - Cold (rare): IgM binds at temp \<37
        - Caused by lymphoproliferative disorder (Waldenström
            Macroglobulinemia), mycoplasma, EBV, HIV
        - Consult heme. Treat underlying. Consider rituximab (steroids
            ineffective)
    - Warm: IgG
        - Idiopathic or associated with lymphoma, SLE, drugs, babesiosis,
            HIV
        - Can use steroids, IVIG, rituximab

## RBC Size Framework

### Normocytic Anemia: MCV 80-100

- Etiologies
    - Anemia of inflammation: (may also be microcytic)
    - Anemia of CKD: low Erythropoietin (EPO) levels
    - Endocrine disease (hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency):
        ↓metabolic demand/O2 requirement
    - Mixed macrocytic/microcytic disease may have a normal MCV: look for
        ↑RDW
    - Pure red cell aplasia: associated with destructive Ab (CLL, thymoma,
        parvovirus, autoimmune)
    - Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)
    - Bone marrow failure or infiltration (typically will see
        pancytopenia)
    - Bone marrow biopsy may be indicated if no identifiable cause or
        anemia is associated with other cytopenia’s

### Microcytic anemia: MCV <80 (mnemonic: SALTI)

- Sideroblastic, Anemia of chronic disease, Lead poisoning,
    Thalassemia and Iron-deficiency

## Management

- If ANC <500
    - Check all lines/IVs for erythema and induration daily
    - Check mouth for mucositis, mouth care after meals and before bed
    - Assess for Neutropenic Fever & Complications – see below
    - Evaluate for indications for prophylaxis – see below
    - No evidence to support use of neutropenic diet
    - No digital rectal exams or enemas/suppositories (risk of bacterial
        translocation)

## Neutropenic Fever

- ANC <500 and T >100.4 °F or 38.0 °C
- Neutropenic pts are unable to mount an adequate immune response and
    can become critically ill very quickly
- Do not wait for a temp re-check, you need to start antibiotics
    immediately

### Evaluation

- Chest X-ray
- Two sets of blood cultures (one from PICC/port if present)
- Urinalysis AND urine culture (not the reflex order set)
- If diarrhea, get C. diff PCR
- If abdominal pain, get CT A/P with IV contrast

### Management

- Empirically treat with Cefepime
- Indications for Vancomycin:
  - Hemodynamically unstable
  - Severe mucositis
  - Focal consolidation on CXR
  - Erythema/induration around line
  - Concern for skin/soft tissue infection
  - GPCs in blood
  - Fever continues \>24h on cefepime
- Additional Coverage:
    - If abdominal pain/diarrhea: Flagyl 500mg q8h
    - Concern for C-diff: PO Vancomycin 125mg q6h
    - Still fevering on Cefepime at 72 hrs (differs by attending)
        Meropenem
- Fungal coverage: Consider if risk factors (TPN) or persistent fevers
    (\>72hrs)
    - Micafungin 100 mg IV daily or Voriconazole 200mg PO BID

## Neutropenic Complications

- Mucositis
    - Presentation
        - Can range from mouth soreness to severe erosions preventing
            eating/drinking
        - Can become secondarily infected with Candida, HSV
    - Management
        - Routine oral care with a soft toothbrush to remove plaque
        - Oral rinses with saline and/or sodium bicarbonate
        - Magic mouthwash for symptomatic relief (or viscous lidocaine at
            the VA)
        - Typically recovers quickly when ANC \> 500

- Neutropenic enterocolitis (Typhlitis)
    - Life-threatening bacterial translocation due to breakdown of
    gut-mucosal barrier
    - Presentation
        - Abdominal pain + fever
        - +/- abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, watery and/or bloody
        diarrhea
    - Diagnosis
        - CT A/P with contrast, consider C. diff PCR if diarrhea
    - Treatment
        - Cefepime/Flagyl OR Zosyn
        - If no perforation/abscess on CT scan, typically continue until 14
            days after ANC recovers \>500 and abdominal pain resolves
        - Can change to cipro/flagyl once ANC \>500
        - If perforation/abscess: will need imaging to confirm resolution, and
            longer duration of abx

- Neutropenic Prophylaxis
    - Used if ANC is expected to be \< 500 for \> 7 days

## Filgrastim (G-CSF – Neupogen/Zarxio/Granix)

- Induces bone marrow production of neutrophils
- Dose: either 300mcg or 480mcg (rounded from 5 mcg/kg/day)
- Common side effects: fatigue, nausea
- PEG-filgrastim (Neulasta): long-acting version that is only given as
    an outpatient

# Thrombocytopenia

Robert Dunn

---

## Background

- Platelet count <150k (mild), 50-100k (moderate), <50k (severe)
- Framework for differential: consumption, sequestration, destruction,
    production
- Causes to consider:
    - Can’t Miss Diagnoses: TTP, HUS, HELLP, DIC, HIT
    - Platelet clumping (lab artifact - pseudothrombocytopenia)
    - Splenomegaly can represent: Plt sequestration, cirrhosis, portal
        hypertension
    - Drug-induced: (Antibiotics, heparin, chemo, GpIIb/IIIa antagonists,
        H2-antagonists)
    - Rheumatologic cause – SLE, sarcoidosis, scleroderma renal crisis
    - Sepsis, independent of DIC
    - Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a diagnosis of exclusion
    - Massive physiologic consumption: large hematoma, active hemorrhage
    - Cirrhosis – results in low thrombopoietin (TPO) and increased
        clearance
    - Chronic alcohol use – direct marrow suppression
    - Infections: HIV, HCV, EBV, Parvovirus, Rickettsia, H. pylori, CMV
    - Bone marrow failure: aplastic anemia, MDS, leukemia, chemotherapy
    - Dilutional: fluid resuscitation and massive transfusion

## Presentation

- Petechiae – typically begins distally on lower legs (in mouth = wet
    purpura), seen when \<10-20k
- Overt bleeding, mucosal bleeding, epistaxis (seen when \<20k)

## Evaluation

- CMP, CBC w/diff, peripheral smear, citrated platelet count, immature
    platelet fraction (IPF)
- LDH, Fibrinogen, d-dimer, PT/aPTT
- Determine timing of decline as well as prior values
- Look at other cell lines - never normal to have two cytopenia’s
- Review recent initiation of drugs: (heparin, antibiotics, and
    chemotherapy)
- Consider abdominal ultrasound to look for splenomegaly and liver
    pathology
- Infectious work up (HIV, HCV)
- Calculate 4T Score and consider your pretest probability for HIT
    testing
- HIT Ab: ELISA is first test – only run once/day at VUMC so order
    early if considering
- Reflex Serotonin release assay (SRA) for confirmation (VUMC performs
    reflexive testing)

## Management

- Plt <50k
    - Discontinue pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis (unless HIT)
    - If on anticoagulation: consider risk/benefits of continued
        anticoagulation
        - Can transfuse plt’s if AC is mandatory
- Plt <10k
    - Transfuse platelets given risk of spontaneous intracranial
        hemorrhage
    - In pt’s with HIT or TTP, there is theoretical concern that
        transfusing plt can “fuel the fire” and lead to more thrombosis, but
        if there is active bleeding then consider platelets
        - Therefore, bleeding with HIT or TTP, discuss with Hematology
            before transfusion
- HIT
    - If pretest probability is high or HIT is confirmed
    - Stop Unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin products
    - Start Argatroban gtt
- If schistocytes present on peripheral smear = concern for TTP
    - Draw ADAMTS13
    - Contact Nephrology and Hematology for PLEX

## Additional Information

- Clumping on lab draws:
    - Obtain Citrated platelet (“blue top” tube – CPRS refers to it as a
        blue top platelet count)
    - If no resolution, obtain a "Gold top" LAB 301 in Epic (Named: Plt
        count) (ACD tube)

# Pancytopenia

Thomas Gracie

---

Background

- Framework for differential:

<!-- -->

- Impaired production (aplastic anemia, marrow infiltration, marrow
    suppression, vitamin/nutritional deficiencies, sepsis, cirrhosis)

- Peripheral destruction (autoimmune hemolytic, hypersplenism)

- Combined process (PNH, SLE, leukemia, HLH, infections)

Evaluation

- Medications: NSAIDs, AEDs, steroids, chemotherapy, antivirals,
    immunosuppression

- PMHx: autoimmune disease (SLE, RA), radiation, gastric surgery,
    malabsorption, liver disease, hematologic malignancy

- Social Hx: EtOH use, malnutrition, occupational exposures, exposures
    to TB or leishmaniasis

- Exam: lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, neuropathy, petechiae,
    stigmata of liver disease, cachexia

- Diagnostic studies: CBC w/ diff, CMP, reticulocyte count, peripheral
    smear, viral studies (hepatitis A/B/C, EBV, CMV, HIV, parvovirus
    B19), vitamin levels (B12, folate, copper, zinc), iron studies,
    hemolysis labs (LDH, haptoglobin, Coombs), flow cytometry, bone
    marrow biopsy, cytogenetics and FISH

Management

- For pancytopenia that is acute (hospital onset) often observation is
    the best approach

- When pancytopenia is slow, progressive over time, or acute without
    any other precipitating factors then would consult hematology for
    consideration of a bone marrow syndromes

Leukocytosis – Kenna Koehler

Background

- Common progenitor cells (stem cells) are located in the bone marrow
    and give rise to erythrocytes, myeloblasts, megakaryoblasts

- Normal WBC can vary by age and pregnancy, for the purpose of this
    section will assume this is for an average, non-pregnant adult

- Chronic mild neutrophilic leukocytosis (10-20k) is common with
    tobacco use and obesity, both due to mechanisms related to chronic
    inflammation

- Reactive (typically 11k-30k) - surgery, exercise, trauma, burns,
    emotional stress

- Leukemoid reaction (typically 50k-100k) - severe infections
    (fulminant *C difficile*), organ rejection

- If greater than 100k, think leukemia or myeloproliferative disorder

Evaluation

- Neutrophilia (neutrophil count \>7k)

<!-- -->

- Bacterial infection, pregnancy, rheumatologic disease, steroids,
    beta agonists, lithium, colony-stimulating factors, splenectomy or
    functional asplenia, congenital (hereditary/chronic idiopathic
    neutrophilia), Down syndrome, leukocyte adhesion deficiency,
    malignancy, smoking, obesity

<!-- -->

- Lymphocytosis (\>40% of WBC count or \>4,500k/mm<sup>3</sup>)

<!-- -->

- Infections (pertussis, syphilis, CMV, EBV, hepatitis A/B/C, toxo),
    hypersensitivity reactions, thyrotoxicosis, Addison's disease,
    hematologic malignancies, “reactive”

<!-- -->

- Monocytosis (\>8% of WBC count or \>880/mm<sup>3</sup>)

<!-- -->

- Infections (TB, fungal disease, protozoa, tick-borne), autoimmune
    disease, malignancy (CMML)

<!-- -->

- Eosinophilia (\>500/mm<sup>3</sup>)

<!-- -->

- Hypersensitivity (asthma, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic
    esophagitis), drug reactions, malignancies, connective tissue
    disease, idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, infections
    (helminths, Scarlet fever, Hansen's disease), sarcoidosis, SLE

- Hypereosinophilia if AEC\>1500, typically merits heme evaluation

- Hypereosinophilic syndrome: AEC\>1500 and organ dysfunction from
    eosinophils

<!-- -->

- Basophilia (\>100/mm<sup>3</sup>)

<!-- -->

- CML, thyroid disease, IBC, chronic dermatitis, infections
    (varicella)

Venous Thromboembolism – Kenna Koehler

Background

- Includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and pulmonary embolism
    (PE). See “Pulmonary Embolism” section in cardiology for more
    information on PEs

- Risk Factors for Provoked DVT/PE

<!-- -->

- Major risk factors: major surgery \>30 minutes, hospitalization \> 3
    days, C-section

- Minor Risk Factors: Surgery \<30 minutes, Hospitalization \<3 days,
    pregnancy, estrogen therapy, reduced mobility \>3 days

<!-- -->

- Non-transient risk factors: Malignancy (active), IBD, liver disease,
    hereditary thrombophilia

Evaluation

- Asymmetric calf swelling of \>2cm sensitivity and specificity for
    DVT of 60-70%

- Wells’ Criteria for DVT can help guide diagnostic testing

<!-- -->

- If a patient has a low pre-test probability, a negative D-dimer can
    rule out DVT

- In a high pre-test probability patient a negative D-dimer is less
    helpful

<!-- -->

- Whole-leg ultrasounds with doppler

Management

- Prophylaxis: Padua score

<!-- -->

- Score \> 4 high risk, recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis

    - Subcutaneous Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) or Subcutaneous
        Heparin

- Score \<4 is low risk; recommend ambulation and SCDs

<!-- -->

- Treatment (see anticoagulation section)

<!-- -->

- Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)

- Oral factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban)

- Intravenous unfractionated heparin

- Warfarin (with bridge therapy)

<!-- -->

- Duration of treatment

<!-- -->

- Provoked: 3 months or until provoking factor (trauma, surgery,
    malignancy) is removed

- Unprovoked: Typically requires life-long anticoagulation along with
    assistance from hematology

<!-- -->

- Anticoagulation in malignancy:

<!-- -->

- LMWH or DOAC (most evidence for apixaban and rivaroxaban) while
    malignancy still active

- Avoid rivaroxaban and edoxaban in GI malignancies (increased rates
    of bleeding)

Additional Information

- Should we get a follow up ultrasound?

<!-- -->

- A follow up ultrasound at the CONCLUSION of anticoagulation can help
    establish a post-treatment baseline and provide a baseline study for
    future comparison that can be critical for the diagnosis of
    recurrent/new DVT (which is very difficult to determine
    radiographically without a comparison imaging study)

<!-- -->

- What about IVC filters?

<!-- -->

- Select circumstances for these: In patients with acute DVT or PE and
    in whom anti-coagulation is absolutely contraindicated
    (thrombocytopenia, recent intra-cranial bleed, recent GI bleed)
    placement of a retrievable IVC filter should be discussed with
    Hematology and IR

Additional Information

- VA is starting to move towards rivaroxaban and apixaban for extended
    secondary thromboprophylaxis

<!-- -->

- Write in your PADR for apixaban citing “patient uses a pillbox and
    cannot use dabigatran”

<!-- -->

- Renal dysfunction: favor warfarin, apixaban or edoxaban

- Hx of GI bleed: avoid dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban (may have
    higher risk of GI bleed)

- Pregnancy: UFH/LMWH (other agents may cross the placenta)

Transitioning Between Anticoagulants with DOACs

- LMWH to Warfarin

<!-- -->

- Warfarin and LMWH given simultaneously until INR is therapeutic for
    24 hours

<!-- -->

- Warfarin to DOAC

<!-- -->

- Start DOAC when INR \< 2.0

<!-- -->

- DOAC to Warfarin

<!-- -->

- High Risk DVT/PE – start LMWH or UFH, then start Warfarin

- Low to Moderate Risk DVT/PE – Start warfarin while patient on DOAC,
    Stop DOAC on Day 3 of warfarin therapy, Check INR on day 4

<!-- -->

- LMWH to DOAC

<!-- -->

- Stop LMWH and start DOAC when due for next dose of LMWH (within 2
    hrs)

<!-- -->

- DOAC to LMWH

<!-- -->

- Stop DOAC and start LMWH when due for next DOAC dose

<!-- -->

- UFH to DOAC

<!-- -->

- Start DOAC when IV stopped (30 min prior to cessation if high risk
    for thrombosis)

- DOAC to UFH

- Start IV heparin with bolus when next DOAC dose is due

Peri-Procedural Management of Anticoagulation

- Temporary IVC filter indicated in pts with very recent acute VTE
    (within 3-4 weeks) if the procedure requires AC delay \>12 hours

- For those at high risk of thromboembolism:

<!-- -->

- Consider continuing AC for low-bleeding-risk procedures, i.e. dental
    procedures, cutaneous biopsy/excision, ICD placement, endovascular
    procedures.

- Can bridge with LMWH or heparin drip

Strategies for Reversal of Anticoagulation

Warfarin

- Vitamin K: onset within a few hours but takes 24-48 hrs for full
    effect

<!-- -->

- Life Threatening Bleeding: Give IV Vitamin K 10 mg over 30 minutes

- Intracranial bleed, bleed with hemodynamic instability, emergent
    procedure non-life threatening

    - INR \<5: Vitamin K not recommended

    - INR 5-10: Vitamin K 1-5 mg IV or PO

    - INR \>10: Vitamin K 5mg PO or 5 mg IV

- Prior to surgery

    - Rapid reversal INR \> 5: 5mg Vit K IV (24 hours prior to
        procedure)

<!-- -->

- FFP

<!-- -->

- 15 ml/kg (i.e. 4 units/70 kg person) if need reversal \<24 hrs, plus
    give Vitamin K

<!-- -->

- KCentra ($$$): Contains Factors II, VII, IX, and X with Protein C,
    Protein S, and heparin

<!-- -->

- Given instead of plasma when insufficient time for plasma/Vit K to
    work (i.e. for life threatening hemorrhage)

- Avoid giving this in HIT

- Administer with Vitamin K

Dabigatran

- Idarucizumab ($$$) will reverse if prolonged thrombin time (remember
    to check!) – Consult Hematology

Factor Xa Inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban)

- FEIBA (Factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity) – can promote
    coagulation but is <u>not a reversal agent</u>; limited data to
    support use

- Consult Hematology before using; andexanet alfa (FDA approved) is
    not on VUMC formulary but is on the VA formulary

Hypercoagulable States – Chris Cann

Background

- Virchow’s triad: 1. Hypercoagulability 2. Stasis 3. Endothelial
    injury

- Diagnostic thrombophilia testing indications:

<!-- -->

- Idiopathic or recurrent VTE

- First VTE at \<40 years old

- VTE in the setting of strong family history

- VTE in unusual vascular site (cerebral, renal, mesenteric)

- Recurrent pregnancy loss

<!-- -->

- Must consider if thrombophilia testing will change clinical
    management

<!-- -->

- If the unprovoked VTE warrants indefinite anticoagulation then
    testing may not be helpful

- However, if VTE provoked by minor risk factor (OCPs) with an
    underlying thrombophilia might change the decision, then testing may
    be informative

<!-- -->

- Separated into Acquired and Hereditary conditions:

<!-- -->

- Hereditary: Factor V Leiden mutation, Prothrombin mutation, Protein
    C or S deficiency, Antithrombin deficiency

- Acquired:

    - Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APLS)

    - Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)

    - Major surgery/trauma

    - Nephrotic Syndrome

    - Smoking

    - Pregnancy

    - Oral Contraceptives

    - Immobilization (bedridden, hip/knee replacement)

    - Active malignancy

    - Estrogen replacement therapy

    - Note: Travel (plane, train, automobile) is NOT on this list and
        this is NOT considered a provoking risk factor

<!-- -->

- Testing: all specific testing for hereditary disorders and APS
    should be performed at least 4-6 weeks after an acute thrombotic
    event or discontinuation of anticoagulant/thrombolytic therapies to
    avoid interference

Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLS)

Background

- Most common acquired disorder (anti-phospholipid antibodies present
    in 3-5% population)

- Recurrent pregnancy loss, provoked DVT in young, unprovoked VTE and
    arterial thrombosis in young, thrombosis unusual sites, thrombosis
    in autoimmune disease

- This is a clinicopathologic diagnosis (need both clinical and
    laboratory criteria)

Evaluation

- Positive for at least 1 lab criterion on at least 2 occasions, at
    least 12 weeks apart:

<!-- -->

- Lupus anticoagulant: can occur in relation to drugs or infection;
    transient are associated with thrombotic risk

- Anticardiolipin antibodies

- B2GP1 (anti-beta2-glycoprotein) antibodies

<!-- -->

- Must also meet at least 1 of the following clinical criteria:

<!-- -->

- Vascular thrombosis: DVT, arterial thrombosis, or small vessel
    thrombosis of any organ

- Pregnancy loss: there are specific criteria for this – consult
    UpToDate or other resource

Management

- Aspirin for primary prevention; warfarin for treatment (INR 2-3)

- Do NOT use DOACs for triple positive APLS (see TRAPS trial:
    rivaroxaban inferior to warfarin)

- Rituximab for recurrent thrombosis despite anticoagulation
    (controversial) – call hematology

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)

Type 1: Mild and self-limited (not immune-mediated)

- Occurs within the first 2 days of first-time exposure

- Platelet count normalizes with continued heparin therapy

Type 2 (what we typically refer to as HIT): Immune mediated

- Fall in plt 30% to over 50% (even if plt count \>150) and/or
    thrombotic event has occurred

<!-- -->

- 4-10 days after new exposure to heparin derivative OR≤

- 1 day after restarting heparin derivative that had been used 30-100
    days prior

    - If exposed to heparin within 100 days, will have platelet drop
        within 24 hr

<!-- -->

- Frequency: unfractionated heparin \> LMWH; Surgical wards \> medical
    wards

- 50% will have thrombotic event in 30 days if HIT is untreated, with
    20% mortality

- Arterial thrombi are common in HIT

- HIT results from antibodies to complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4)
    and heparin, further activating platelets (the activated platelets
    aggregate causing thrombocytopenia)

Evaluation

- 4T score (0-8 points):

<!-- -->

- Thrombocytopenia (0-2 pts): degree and nadir of platelet count drop

- Timing (0-2 pts): timing of fall after initial or recurrent heparin
    exposure

- Thrombosis (0-2 pts): thrombosis, skin necrosis, non-necrotizing
    lesions, acute systemic reaction to heparin

- Other causes of thrombocytopenia (0-2 pts): more points if no
    alternate cause

<!-- -->

- Solid-phase ELISA for heparin-PF4 antibodies:

<!-- -->

- 0.2-0.4 is indeterminate

- \> 0.4 is positive

- \> 1.4 HIT is likely

- \> 2 confirms HIT

- The lab at VUMC will perform functional SRA reflexively for all
    values \>0.2

Management

- 0-3 points: Low concern for HIT; can restart heparin

- 4-5 points: Intermediate probability (\~10%) - hold heparin, start
    non-heparin anticoagulant

- 6 points: High probability (\~50%) - hold heparin, start non-heparin
    anticoagulant

- Argatroban (direct thrombin inhibitor) for prophylaxis and treatment
    of thrombosis

<!-- -->

- Avoid platelet transfusions as can increase thrombogenic effect

- Avoid warfarin until complete platelet recovery as may cause
    microthrombosis

<!-- -->

- Hematology consult for all confirmed HIT

Factor V Leiden mutation

Evaluation

- Activated protein C resistance assay

<!-- -->

- APC ratio in patient vs normal

- normal \>2.0, heterozygotes 1.5-2.0, homozygotes \<1.5

<!-- -->

- FVL mutation is then determined via PCR

- Screen with APC assay rather than PCR initially; cost effective

Management

- VTE treatment same as general population

<!-- -->

- VTE 4-8x risk in heterozygotes; 80x risk in homozygotes

<!-- -->

- Avoid OCPs: increased risk for VTE

Prothrombin gene mutation

Evaluation:

- PCR of G20210A mutation (2-4% prevalence)

Management:

- VTE treatment same as general population & avoid OCPs

Protein C & S Deficiency

Background

- Autosomal dominant; first event occurs between 10-50 years of age

- Synthesized in liver and Vit K dependent, therefore low levels in
    hepatic dysfunction and warfarin use/vitamin K deficiency

- Protein C: low in settings of thrombosis, DIC, nephrotic syndrome,
    intra/post-op

- Protein S: low in infectious (HIV) and autoimmune processes (IBD)

- Protein S decreases during pregnancy (decreased free Protein S,
    normal total Protein S)

<!-- -->

- Do not misdiagnose a pregnant patient with PS deficiency

Evaluation

- Functional Protein C & S assays

Management

- VTE treatment same as general population

- Avoid OCPs

- High risk patients may require protein C concentrate prior to
    surgery

- Increased risk of warfarin-induced skin necrosis

Antithrombin deficiency

Background

- Autosomal dominant, does not skip generations

- VTE in unusual sites (cerebral sinuses, renal veins)

- Present \< 50 y/o, but rarely in first two decades

- Decreased in liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, protein losing
    enteropathy, burn, trauma, bypass surgery, metastatic tumors,
    premenopausal, OCP use, pregnancy

Evaluation

- Functional antithrombin activity (AT-heparin cofactor assay)

- Then perform antigen quantity testing

Management

- Can use Argatroban as does not require antithrombin function

- Warfarin preferred in VTE (titrate up based on expression of
    antithrombin deficiency)

Coagulopathies – Jason Jones

- Step one: determine if platelet vs coagulation disorder

- Platelet Disorders: Skin/mucous membrane bleeding; Petechiae; Often
    mild bleeding following surgery and tends to immediately follow
    surgery

- Coagulation defect: Bleeding deep in soft tissues (muscles/joints);
    hemarthroses, hematomas; tendency to have delayed bleeding after
    surgery that can be severe

- Coagulopathies can be divided into Hereditary vs Acquired causes

Hereditary

Hemophilia A (Factor VIII Deficiency) and Hemophilia B (Factor IX
Deficiency)

- Inherited in X-linked Recessive pattern

- Diagnosis: Isolated prolonged PTT with normalization upon mixing
    study

- Management: purified/recombinant Factor VIII or IX. Desmopressin for
    mild disease

- Consult benign hematology every time these patients are admitted

von Willebrand Disease (vWD)

- Can be hereditary (common) or acquired

- Abnormal quantity or function of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) needed
    for platelet function

- Type 1 (most common): Quantitative defect. Low quantity, normal
    function of vWF

- Type 2: Qualitative defect. Normal quantity, abnormal function of
    vWF.

- Type 3 (rare): Complete absence of vWF, phenotypically similar to
    hemophilia A

- Order in Epic: vW Profile = vWF Ag, Factor VIII Activity, Ristocetin
    Cofactor Activity

- Management: Desmopressin (DDAVP) can be useful as prophylaxis or
    treatment; most patients are treated with factor concentrate
    replacements

Acquired

Coagulation Factor Inhibitors

- Associated with autoimmune disease (paraneoplastic vs. autoantibody)

- Seen in hemophilia due to frequent treatments with recombinant
    factors (alloantibody)

- Diagnosis: Elevated PTT that does not normalize with mixing study

- Management: Immunosuppression with steroids; cyclophosphamide +/-
    rituximab

<!-- -->

- Consult Hematology always (rare disorder with major bleeding
    complications)

Vitamin K Deficiency

- Caused by malnutrition, liver disease, or iatrogenic with warfarin

- Diagnosis: elevated PT, if severe may have prolonged PTT as well

- Management: Replace vitamin K

Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) - Eric Singhi

Background

- Concurrent activation of the coagulation pathway and fibrinolytic
    pathway

<!-- -->

- Consumption of platelets, fibrin, and coagulation factors
    fibrinolysis end organ damage and hemolysis

<!-- -->

- Etiologies:

<!-- -->

- Infection/Sepsis, Liver disease, Pancreatitis, Trauma

- Malignancies: mucin-secreting pancreatic/gastric adenocarcinoma,
    brain tumors, prostate cancer, all acute leukemias, acute
    promyelocytic leukemia

- Obstetric complications (i.e. preeclampsia/eclampsia, placental
    abruption)

- Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (i.e. ABO incompatible
    transfusion)

Evaluation

- Exam: petechiae, bleeding (mucosal, IV site, surgical wound site,
    hematuria), ecchymoses, thrombosis (i.e. cold, pulseless
    extremities)

- CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, Fibrinogen, D-Dimer, Peripheral Blood Smear

- “DIC labs” = q6h fibrinogen, PT/INR, aPTT (space out when lower
    risk)

- Findings suggestive of DIC: thrombocytopenia, prolonged aPTT and
    PT/INR, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated D-dimer, fibrin degradation
    products, schistocytes

Management

- Treat the underlying cause!

- Vitamin K for INR \> 1.7 or bleeding

- Hypofibrinogenemia treatment: Cryoprecipitate 5-10 units if
    fibrinogen \< 100

- Thrombocytopenia treatment: plt transfusion as normally indicated

- DVT ppx if not bleeding and plt \> 50

- VTE: anticoagulation if plt \> 50 and no massive bleeding

Transfusion Medicine – R. Dixon Dorand

For emergent transfusions, call the blood bank (615-322-2233)

- RNs on 10T and 11N can follow transfusion protocols for pRBCs and
    Plts – enter as a Nursing Communication or as part of the
    Hematology/Oncology Admission Order set.

- At VUMC, all special processing of blood products (such as
    irradiation) will be decided by blood bank based on special
    considerations listed in order set. Examples include: stem cell
    transplant, hematologic malignancy, or thalassemia

- Patients with frequent transfusions (e.g. sickle cell
    hemoglobinopathy) should have an RBC Extended Phenotype ordered
    (once) for minor RBC antigens to avoid immunization and antibody
    development to these proteins

- You may ask the VUMC hematology lab to email you pictures of the
    peripheral smear

VA: Orders Tab – Blood Bank Orders – follow prompts to select
appropriate product. Must order both the blood product AND the
transfusion order (“Transfuse blood”)

- You need to specify all special processing such as irradiation

- To order a Type & Screen as a lab, you must go to Blood Bank Orders

- Type & Screen and Transfusion results are under the Blood tab in
    Results

Red Blood Cell Transfusion

- Volume 200-300 mL per unit prbc

- In general, 1 unit of packed RBCs increases Hgb by 1g/dL and HCT by
    \~3%

- Assessment of the post-transfusion Hgb can be performed 15 min
    following transfusion, but ideally 1 hour after completion

Indications:

- Hgb \<9-10 g/dL – Acute coronary syndrome

- Hgb \<8 g/dL or Hct \<25 – Bone marrow failure or receiving
    antineoplastic therapy

<!-- -->

- Also sometimes used in pts with pre-existing CAD

<!-- -->

- Hgb \<7 g/dL or Hct \<21 – ICU, GI Bleeding, Oncology patient on
    Treatment

Indications for Platelets

- \<11 k/µL – all patients, reduce risk of spontaneous hemorrhage (use
    on BMT, Brittingham)

- \<50 k/µL – active bleeding, scheduled to undergo select invasive
    procedure

- \<100 k/µL – CNS hemorrhage, intrathecal catheter

<!-- -->

- This is also the threshold used for most Neurosurgical procedures

Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) & Cryoprecipitate (Cryo)

Cryoprecipitate

- FFP enriched for von Willebrand factor, factor VIII, factor XIII,
    and fibrinogen

FFP

- Once thawed, must be used in 24 hrs (due to decline in labile
    coagulation factors)

- Must be ABO compatible but not crossmatched or Rh typing

- Only administer FFP if INR ≥1.7 (FFP will not fix an INR \< 1.7)

Indications for transfusion

- Bleeding:

<!-- -->

- FFP If INR \>1.7

- Cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen \<100.

<!-- -->

- DIC:

<!-- -->

- Fibrinogen \<100: Transfuse 5 – 10 units cryoprecipitate and repeat
    fibrinogen. If bleeding, consider raising transfusion threshold of
    cryoprecipitate to fibrinogen \<150

- For elevated INR, consider FFP transfusion. Thresholds for doing
    this vary by attending

<!-- -->

- Cirrhosis:

<!-- -->

- General concept: PT/INR, aPTT are unreliable markers for bleeding.
    Fibrinogen ≤100 – 120 or thromboelastography are better surrogates
    for bleeding risk

- Transfuse fibrinogen ≤100 – 120 if the patient is actively bleeding
    or about to undergo a procedure or surgery other than paracentesis

- Transfuse FFP based on hepatology team preference (generally few
    indications for FFP)

Transfusion Premedication & Reactions

- If you are concerned about a serious transfusion reaction, pause the
    transfusion and contact the blood bank asap

- Order the transfusion reaction blood testing in Epic. You will send
    a CBC, the bag of blood products, and the completed form to the
    blood bank for analysis

Premedication:

- Only if history of severe reaction

<!-- -->

- Diphenhydramine 25-50mg IV

- Acetaminophen 650 mg PO

- Meperidine 25-50 mg IV (optional for chills)

- Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV (optional, for severe reactions or reactions
    despite acetaminophen and diphenhydramine)

Sickle Cell Crisis – Michael J. Neuss

Background

- Present with severe pain in bone, joints, chest, abdomen

- Causes: (HIDISC) Hypoxia, Ischemia, Dehydration, Infection, Stress,
    Cold

- Can’t Miss:

<!-- -->

- Acute chest: hypoxia + fever + chest pain + new infiltrate on CXR
    (consult benign hematology immediately, do not wait until the next
    day)

- PE (ACS less likely in these patients); avascular necrosis of hip,
    priapism, stroke

Evaluation

- Labs: LDH (high), Hgb/Hct (low; check vs baseline), retic, smear,
    WBC

- If febrile: UA + Blood cultures

- Send Hgb S level, and compare to baseline w/ other hospital
    admissions

- Imaging: CXR, MRI for hip pain, Abdominal U/S or CT abdomen

- Maintain active type and cross given probability of antibodies

Management

- General:

<!-- -->

- Look for a care coordination yellow note in the Summary Tab

    - Heme clinic will have specific management preferences for
        individual patients

- Maintain hydration, IVF at 150-200 cc/hr (if no contraindication)

- Oxygen: goal sat \~95% (higher O2 goal will help to prevent further
    sickling!)

- Continue folic acid 1 mg qDay

- Continue hydroxyurea if uncomplicated pain crisis

    - Hold if counts suppressed or concern for infection

- If in the MICU: consider discussion for plasma exchange (if Hgb SS
    or SC or S-Thal)

- Transfuse: Simple transfusion if Hgb lower than baseline and/or
    complications

    - Avoid transfusions when able, given risk of antibody formation

<!-- -->

- Pain:

<!-- -->

- Will generally require opiates, likely initiation of PCA

- All SS patients should have pain plans; inpatient pain plans are in
    the problem list under sickle cell disease or in the care
    coordination section of Epic

- Outpatient plans (to which you will transition pts back prior to
    discharge) are not standardized in location, but can be under Media
    (with a pain contract) or found in notes

<!-- -->

- Acute chest:

<!-- -->

- Consult Hematology at time of admission

- D5 1/2 NS @ 150-250 cc/hr

- Transfuse hgb to \>10

- PCA w/ dilaudid

- Abx for CAP (vs HAP if risk factors) ± bronchodilators

Lymphoma – Danielle Fishman

Background

- Classically characterized by lymphadenopathy & constitutional “B”
    symptoms: fevers, drenching night sweats and weight loss

- **Hodgkin:** 10% - superficial, nodal disease with orderly spread

<!-- -->

- Bimodal Distribution: 15-35 years and \>50 years; M\>F

- CD15+, CD30+ (Reed Sternberg cells “owl eyes”)

- Associated with EBV in immunocompromised patient

<!-- -->

- **Non-Hodgkin:** 90% - diffuse, nodal and extranodal disease with
    noncontiguous spread

<!-- -->

- Average 65 years, M\>F, 85-90% B-cell

- Associated with immunodeficiency (HIV, post-transplant), autoimmune
    disease, infection (EBV, HTLV-1, H pylori, HCV, Borrelia, C
    psittacosis, Coxiella)

General Evaluation

- History

<!-- -->

- B symptoms; pruritus (10-15% of pt with HL); history of radiation

<!-- -->

- Physical Exam

<!-- -->

- Head & neck, tonsils, axilla, testes, liver, spleen

- Lymphadenopathy: painless, firm, fixed, \>1cm

<!-- -->

- Lab tests:

<!-- -->

- CBC, CMP, LDH, Uric Acid, Phosphorus

- Consider HBV, HCV, HIV, EBV, Quant gold, Treponemal Ab, ANA

<!-- -->

- Imaging:

<!-- -->

- CT chest, abdomen, pelvis

- Most will eventually need PET-CT; MRI brain if neuro symptoms

<!-- -->

- Consider LP for NHL with high risk of CNS involvement or presence of
    neurological symptoms

<!-- -->

- Risk factors: Burkitt, Lymphoblastic, testicular involvement,
    double/triple hit

- Multiple LPs may be required to diagnose CNS lymphoma

<!-- -->

- Diagnosis requires tissue

<!-- -->

- Excisional Lymph node biopsy (Surg Onc Consult)

- Core biopsy (CT guided procedure consult)

- Of note, steroids may impact value of biopsy results

<!-- -->

- Lugano Classification: staging of lymphoma

<!-- -->

- I. 1 LN region or single extra lymphatic organ/site without nodal
    involvement

- II\. \>2 LN regions, same side of diaphragm

- III\. LN regions on both sides of diaphragm

- IV\. Disseminated disease w/ 1+ extralymphatic organ

Myelodysplastic Syndromes – Peter Hanna

Background

- MDS is a malignant clonal myeloid disorder resulting in ineffective
    (dysplastic) hematopoiesis leading to peripheral cytopenia’s and a
    risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)

- Usually idiopathic, a disease of the elderly (median onset at age
    70)

- The WHO has several classification schemes for MDS

<!-- -->

- Most important for classification is the percent of blasts in the
    bone marrow

- Note \>20% blasts in marrow = AML. Thus MDS & AML are on a continuum

Presentation

- 50% asymptomatic; Symptoms can include nonspecific but gradual
    fatigue, weakness

- Dysplastic cells do not work properly infections and bleeding are
    more likely

- Macrocytic anemia is most common finding; followed by bicytopenia or
    pancytopenia

- Isolated neutropenia or thrombocytopenia are unusual but possible

- Ask about secondary causes:

<!-- -->

- Exposure to chemicals (benzene, crude oil/gasoline industry,
    cigarette smoke), chemotherapy, radiation

- Medications, alcohol use, chronic infections (HIV)

Evaluation

- Goal is to rule out reversible causes of dysplasia and cytopenias

- CBC w/differential, Peripheral Smear, B12, Folate, HIV

<!-- -->

- May consider Copper & Zinc (send out labs, are expensive and rare
    but check when MDS is being considered)

<!-- -->

- Dysplastic changes on peripheral smear: hypogranulated/hyposegmented
    neutrophils, hypogranulated platelets and macrocytosis of RBCs

<!-- -->

- Circulating myeloblasts can be seen

<!-- -->

- Final diagnosis made by Bone marrow Biopsy

Management

- Molecular characteristics define the “risk” of the disease and
    dictates treatments

- Prognostic scoring tools: revised international prognostic staging
    system (R-IPSS)

- Management general paradigm:

<!-- -->

- Asymptomatic: with low-risk disease = monitoring

- Low-risk disease + symptoms due to anemia only: transfusions,
    erythrocyte stimulating agents, and treatment with Luspatercept

- MDS with isolated del(5q): treated with lenalidomide

- High-risk patients: treated with hypomethylating agents

- Only curative intervention = hematopoietic stem cell transplant
    (HSCT)

Acute Leukemia – Robert Corty

Background

- Hematology malignant caused by unchecked proliferation of WBC
    precursors in the bone marrow

- Pt’s with suspected acute leukemia require hospitalization for
    urgent diagnosis & treatment

- Types:

<!-- -->

- AML = Acute Myeloid Leukemia

    - APL = Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia defined by translocation
        (15;17) PML-RARA

- ALL = Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia

<!-- -->

- Risk Factors:

<!-- -->

- radiation, chemical exposures (e.g benzene), chemotherapy (esp
    alkylating agents)

- HIV, immunosuppression, smoking

- myeloproliferative disorders, aplastic anemia

Presentation

- Leukocytosis, leukemia cutis, gingival hypertrophy, leukostasis

- Functional Leukopenia, often neutropenia: recurrent infections

- Anemia: fatigue, pallor, dyspnea

- Thrombocytopenia: gingival bleeding, epistaxis, petechiae,
    ecchymoses, menorrhagia

- Extramedullary hematopoiesis: splenomegaly, hepatomegaly,
    lymphadenopathy

Evaluation

- Diagnosis of acute leukemia requires one of the following:

<!-- -->

- 20% blasts in peripheral blood

- \> 20% blasts in bone marrow biopsy

- Any pathognomonic cytogenetic abnormality of t(8;21), inv(16),
    t(15;17)

<!-- -->

- Check for the presence of these time-sensitive conditions.

<!-- -->

- DIC – check fibrinogen, PT, PTT, platelets

- TLS – check uric acid, phosphate, K+

- Neutropenic fever – check temp, neutrophil count

- Leukostasis (see below)

- Presumptive APL – promyelocytes on diff, DIC or Auer rods on smear

<!-- -->

- Confirm if peripheral flow cytometry ordered/in process

- Use hematology admission order set

<!-- -->

- Set RBC and Plt transfusion thresholds

- Order nurse-driven electrolyte repletion

- ECG and TTE to establish pre-chemotherapy cardiac function

- Daily labs: CBC, TLS, DIC

- TLS prophylaxis

Management

- Consult hematology

<!-- -->

- Discuss chemo plan and order double lumen PICC for reliable access

- If findings suggest APL start ATRA

- Subspecialized lab tests: bone marrow biopsy, cytogenetics, FISH

<!-- -->

- Monitor for Common Complications/Emergencies: (see individual
    sections)

<!-- -->

- TLS, DIC, Febrile Neutropenia, Leukostasis

Additional Information

- Obtain blood product consent on admission

- APL Specific findings: promyelocytes on differential or Auer rods on
    smear

- Differentiation syndrome: promyelocytes differentiate

<!-- -->

- Symptoms and signs: fever, SOB, Hypotn, peripheral edema, pleural
    effusion, AKI

- Diagnosis: No defined criteria. If suspicious, discuss with
    hematology fellow

- Management: steroids. If critically ill, hold ATRA and ATO and
    consider hydroxyurea

Leukemia Treatment Overview

- General strategy is to use “induction” chemo to try to induce
    clinicopathologic (as opposed to molecular) “remission”

- Defined as absence of symptoms, normal CBC, and \< 5% blasts in bone
    marrow (on day 28)

- Then waiting in hospital until neutrophil count \> 500 (typically
    \~3 weeks)

- From there, bone marrow transplant (for high-risk disease) or
    “consolidation” chemo for normal-risk or low-risk disease

AML

- Induction

<!-- -->

- Typical is “7+3” i.e. idrarubicin on days 1-3 and cytarabine on days
    1-7

- If therapy-related AML, MDS-related AML, or AML with cytogenetics
    similar to MDS, use “Vyxeos” which is liposomal daunorubicin and
    cytarabine on days 1, 3, and 5

- If low-risk dz (t(8;21) or inv(16)), use cytarabine on days 1-7, and
    3 days of low-dose daunorubicin + gemtuzumab-ozogamicin

- There are other induction regimens that can be used depending on
    specific cytogenetics and patient frailty, which is beyond the scope
    of the handbook

<!-- -->

- Consolidation

<!-- -->

- Typically “HiDAC”(high-dose Ara-C i.e. cytarabine)

    - Generally too toxic for pts with age \> 60, so a dose reduction
        is used

- In the case of relapse, typical treatment is a different high-dose
    chemo and BMT if possible

ALL

- Typical induction is “HyperCVAD” (hyper-fractionated
    cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin (“A” due to trade name
    Adriamycin), and dexamethasone

- If t(9;22) (known as Philadelphia chromosome), use tyrosine kinase
    inhibitor (TKI)

- If CD20+, use rituximab

Plasma Cell Dyscrasias – Rahul Shah, Jennifer Marvin-Peek

Background

- A heterogenous group of benign, premalignant, and malignant
    conditions characterized by clonal proliferation of plasma cells

- Results in over-production of monoclonal immunoglobulins or
    polypeptides (i.e., M-protein) that can be detected in serum and/or
    urine

- Includes monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS),
    smoldering myeloma (SMM), multiple myeloma (MM), Waldenström
    Macroglobulinemia (WM), extra-medullary plasmacytoma, AL
    amyloidosis, POEMS syndrome

- Spectrum of MGUS, SMM, and MM represents natural progression of same
    disease process

- Complications: Increased infectious risk, cytopenias, renal failure,
    hyperviscosity syndrome, malignant hypercalcemia, pain crisis from
    bony disease

- Elevated gamma/protein gap (serum total protein minus albumin \>4)
    often prompts work-up for an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia (high
    specificity but low sensitivity)

Evaluation

- CBC w/ diff, peripheral blood smear, CMP (for Ca, Cr, albumin), LDH,
    CRP, urinalysis

- SPEP with immunofixation, UPEP (24-hour urine) with immunofixation,
    serum free light chains (FLC)

- Quantitative immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG, IgD, IgE)

- If Hgb \<10, Cr \>2, Ca \>11.5, M-protein \>1.5, non-IgG M-spike,
    abnormal FLC ratio:

<!-- -->

- Bone marrow biopsy + cytogenetics

- β2-microglobulin, serum viscosity (in WM)

- Skeletal imaging to identify bone lesions: skeletal survey (x-ray)
    often done initially, then more sensitive CT/PET-CT/MRI if biopsy
    shows SMM/MM

- If considering amyloidosis: abdominal wall fat pad biopsy with Congo
    red staining typically sufficient vs direct biopsy of
    amyloid-involved tissue

Multiple Myeloma

Evaluation

- Diagnosis requires clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥10% or
    bony/extramedullary plasmacytoma AND one or more end-organ event
    (CRAB criteria) or biomarker of myeloma

- CRAB criteria

    - Hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, bone osteolytic lesions

<!-- -->

- Biomarkers of multiple myeloma

    - Clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 60%

    - Serum FLC ratio ≥ 100 or ≤ 0.01

    - \>1 focal lesion ≥ 5mm on MRI

- Skeletal imaging: Whole-body PET-CT or CT preferred, MRI, bone
    survey (x-ray)

Management

- First-line induction therapy typically is RVd: immunomodulatory
    agent (lenalidomide \[<u>R</u>evlimid\]), proteasome inhibitor
    (bortezomib \[<u>V</u>elcade\]) and <u>d</u>examethasone

- Consolidation therapy includes autologous SCT for transplant
    eligible patients

- Maintenance therapy is often given indefinitely, typically
    lenalidomide or bortezomib

- Relapsed disease is often treated with anti-CD38 monoclonal Ab
    (daratumumab) with a steroid and either immunomodulatory drug or
    proteosome inhibitor; CAR-T also recently approved for relapsed MM

- Supportive Care

<!-- -->

- VTE prophylaxis with DOAC or LMWH if on an immunomodulatory agent
    > with 2 VTE risk factors; if only 0-1 VTE risk factors aspirin

<!-- -->

- EPO and G-CSF for treatment-related anemia and neutropenia

- Bisphosphonate (ideally zoledronic acid) to reduce risk of
    > fractures; analgesia ± radiotherapy for bone pain and palliation

- (Val)acyclovir if on bortezomib for VZV prophylaxis

Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma/Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (IgM)

Presentation

- Hyperviscosity syndrome: blurred vision, dizziness, diplopia,
    hypoxia, ataxia, vertigo, stroke, coma

- Peripheral neuropathy

- Retinal changes: dilated veins, hemorrhages, papilledema

- Cryoglobulinemia: large IgM complexes precipitate out in the cold,
    causing Raynaud's, urticaria, purpura, acral cyanosis, tissue
    necrosis

Evaluation

- Requires: IgM monoclonal gammopathy on SPEP, BM biopsy w/≥10%
    lymphocytes with plasmacytoid differentiation (late stage B-cell
    differentiation), and MYD88 mutation detected

- CBC, coagulation studies, cryoglobulins, IgM, β2-microglobulin

- Serum viscosity (If \<4 symptoms are rare, If \>6 typically
    symptomatic)

Management

- Asymptomatic patients managed with close observation

- Symptomatic hyperviscosity is treated with plasmapheresis

- Induction: may include bendamustine +/- rituximab if IgM level is
    \<4000 (Rituximab can temporarily ↑ IgM and ↑ risk of hyperviscosity
    syndrome)

- Monitor response with: IgM levels, monoclonal IgM on SPEP

Other Plasma Cell Dyscrasias

Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis

- Extracellular deposition of misfolded light chains (most commonly
    kidney & heart)

<!-- -->

- Features: nephrotic syndrome, restrictive CM, peripheral neuropathy,
    > HSM, macroglossia, easy bruising/bleeding,
    > dysautonomia/orthostasis

<!-- -->

- Diagnosis:

    - Need ALL 4: amyloid related systemic syndrome, positive congo
        > red staining on any tissue, evidence that amyloid is light
        > chain related, evidence of monoclonal plasma cell disorder

POEMS Syndrome

- Cause unknown, possibly chronic overproduction of pro-inflammatory
    cytokines such as VEGF

- Features: Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Monoclonal
    protein (usually λ light chain), Skin changes

- Diagnosis:

<!-- -->

- Mandatory Criteria: peripheral neuropathy, monoclonal plasma cell
    disorder

- Major Criteria (need 1/3): osteosclerotic lesions, VEGF, Castleman
    disease

- Minor Criteria (need 1/6): organomegaly, volume overload,
    endocrinopathy, skin changes, papilledema, thrombocytosis or
    polycythemia

Castleman Disease

- Angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia

- Antibodies to HHV-8 implicated in \>50% of cases

- Features: Lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats, fatigue, fluid
    accumulation, violaceous lymph node biopsy w/characteristic
    hematopathology papules

Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs) – Christina Snider

Background

- MPNs = chronic myeloid disorders caused by abnormal proliferation of
    mature bone marrow cell lineages (granulocytes, erythrocytes, or
    megakaryocytes)

- MPNs differ from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); cells in MPNs are
    normally developed (i.e. not dysplastic)

- Four “classic” MPNs: polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia,
    primary myelofibrosis and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)

Polycythemia Vera (PV)

Background

- Polycythemia is a general term: Men = Hb/Hct \> 16.5/49%; Women =
    Hb/Hct \> 16/48%

- Relative polycythemia = Concentrated H/H due to decreased plasma
    volume

<!-- -->

- Diuretic use, vomiting, diarrhea; H/H should normalize with fluid
    resuscitation

<!-- -->

- Absolute polycythemia = Increased RBC mass

<!-- -->

- Primary polycythemia: 2/2 Inherited/acquired mutation in RBC
    progenitor

- Secondary polycythemia: Increase in RBC mass due to elevated serum
    EPO

    - Hypoxia/cardiopulmonary associated (chronic pulmonary disease,
        R-to-L cardiac shunts, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation
        syndrome, chronic carbon monoxide poisoning, including heavy
        smoking)

    - Kidney associated causes (following renal transplant, renal
        artery stenosis, hydronephrosis)

    - Autonomous EPO production from an EPO-producing tumors (rare)

    - Steroid Use

<!-- -->

- Epidemiology: Median age of diagnosis is 60 years; 25% cases present
    at age \<50 years.

- \>95% PV pts have JAK2 V617F mutation, but JAK2 V617F mutation is
    not specific to PV and can be seen in other MPNs

Presentation

- Incidentally elevated H/H

- Splenomegaly, generalized pruritus (post-warm bath/shower), unusual
    thrombosis

- Erythromelalgia: intermittent occurrence of red, hot, painful
    extremities

Evaluation

- CBC with differential and peripheral smear

- EPO level

- Rule out secondary causes: Sleep Study, Carboxyhemoglobin, steroids

- Peripheral blood screen for JAK2 V617F mutation

Management

- PV treatment aims to prevent thrombosis and bleeding events.

- Phlebotomy: maintain Hct \<45% (One unit 500 mL decreases Hct by 3%)

- ASA 81 mg for thrombosis prevention and symptom control

- Hydroxyurea: indicated for high-risk patients (\>60 years old or
    with history of thrombosis)

- Interferon-alfa, busulfan, or ruxolitinib: indicated in select
    high-risk patients

Essential thrombocythemia (ET)

Background

- Clonal stem cell disorder w/ increased platelet counts (\>450k/uL)

- Risks of thrombosis and hemorrhage

- Median age of diagnosis: 60 years; Twice as common in females.

Presentation

- Incidental thrombocytosis on CBC

- Splenomegaly, unusual thrombosis, and erythromelalgia

Evaluation

- Screen for conditions that cause reactive thrombocytosis: Chronic
    inflammatory diseases, infections, bleeding/hemolysis, iron
    deficiency, post splenectomy

- CBC with smear (platelet anisocytosis) ranging from very small to
    giant platelets

- CMP, LDH, Uric Acid, iron studies

- BCR ABL1 testing should be sent to exclude CML

- Bone marrow biopsy with staining, cytogenetics, and molecular
    testing for JAK2, CALR, MPL mutations

Management

- Avoid ASA 81 in patients with platelet counts \>1 million
    complicated by acquired von Willebrand syndrome due to increased
    risk of bleeding

Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF)

Background

- Clonal proliferation of myeloid cells with variable morphologic
    maturity resulting in reactive marrow fibrosis and extramedullary
    hematopoiesis

- Least favorable prognosis out of MPN

Presentation

- Fatigue, weight loss, low grade fever, bone pain, and night sweats

- Marked splenomegaly +/-hepatomegaly (due to extramedullary
    hematopoiesis)

Evaluation

- smear: teardrop shaped RBCs (dacrocytes)

- Bone marrow biopsy: “dry tap” due to extensive reticulin and/or
    collagen fibrosis mutually exclusive mutations in JAK2, MPL, or CALR

Management

- Low risk patients: Observe if asymptomatic

- Cure by allogenic HCT transplantation in young, high-risk patients

- Treatment of anemias include transfusion support

- Surgical splenectomy if abdominal pain or transfusion dependent
    anemia (used very infrequently)

Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)

Background

- Definition: MPN characterized by the overproduction of myeloid stem
    cells that can differentiate

- Chronic phase:

<!-- -->

- Fatigue, weight loss, bleeding

- Abdominal fullness and early satiety due to splenomegaly

- WBC on CBC is typically \>100k, and smear shows neutrophilic cells
    in all stages of maturation with \<2% blasts

<!-- -->

- Accelerated phase: Refractory leukocytosis, 10-19% blasts in
    peripheral blood or bone marrow, worsening peripheral basophilia,
    thrombocytopenia

- Blast phase = acute leukemia. \>20% blasts in peripheral blood or
    bone marrow, extramedullary proliferation of blasts

Evaluation

- Typical findings in blood and bone marrow and confirmation of
    Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL1 fusion gene) via conventional
    cytogenetics, FISH, or rt-PCR

Management

- Hydroxyurea can be used to reduce WBC while awaiting confirmation

- Oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIS): Imatinib, dasatinib,
    nilotinib, and ponatinib

- Allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation: Curative option for
    pts in accelerated and blast phase, as well as young pts w/chronic
    phase CML who do not respond to TKI therapy

Bone Marrow Transplant – Chelsie Sievers

Background

- Donor selection

<!-- -->

- Autologous: self, no matching required (no GVHD risk, but also no
    graft-vs-tumor effect)

- Allogeneic: non-self, matching based on HLA (more matched = less
    GVHD risk)

    - Matched-related donor (MRD): fully matched sibling

    - Matched-unrelated donor (MUD): From NMDP database

    - Haploidentical: Half matched sibling or parent

<!-- -->

- Source of stem cells:

<!-- -->

- Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) vs bone marrow-derived cells vs
    umbilical cord

<!-- -->

- Conditioning regimens:

<!-- -->

- Myeloablative vs Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC)

<!-- -->

- GVHD prophylaxis (for allo-SCT):

<!-- -->

- Regimen varies, can include tacrolimus, MMF, MTX, or thymo and
    alemtuzumab during conditioning

    Complications/Adverse Effects:

<!-- -->

- Infectious

<!-- -->

- Neutropenic fever, neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis)

- Bacterial infections

- Viral infections

    - CMV: check weekly PCR levels post-allo-SCT

        - All CMV+ recipients are treated with letermovir
            prophylactically regardless of donor status

    - EBV: check weekly PCR levels post allo-SCT. If EBV VL \>1000 on
        two occasions, can treat with pre-emptive rituximab to reduce
        the risk of PTLD

- Invasive fungal infections (e.g. aspergillus, candida)

<!-- -->

- Non-infectious

<!-- -->

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, cytopenias

- Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD)/sinusoidal obstructive syndrome
    (SOS)

    - Pathophysiology: sinusoidal endothelial cell damage from
        conditioning chemo post-sinusoidal portal HTN cytokine release
        multiorgan failure and death

    - Diagnosis: T Bili \>2, hepatomegaly/RUQ pain, weight gain \>
        2-5%

    - Evaluation: RUQ US with doppler

    - Treatment: Per heme attending; generally supportive, consider
        defibrotide

- Graft failure:

    - Primary (persistent neutropenia without engraftment)

    - Secondary (delayed pancytopenia 2/2 immune phenomena or
        infection after engraftment)

- Engraftment syndrome:

    - Pathophysiology: PMN recovery cytokine storm vascular leak

    - Symptoms: fever, tachycardia, hypotension, SOB, pulmonary edema,
        rash, weight gain, bone pain, confusion

    - Diagnosis: Clinical

    - Treatment: high-dose IV steroids

- Acute GVHD:

    - Only in allogenic; Increased risk with more HLA mismatch

    - Pathophysiology: donor T cells attack recipient (Th1-mediated)

    - Symptoms: skin rash, cholestatic liver injury, diarrhea

    - Treatment: IV steroids (methylprednisolone 1-2mg/kg x 5d)

        - If refractory: mycophenolate, etanercept, ruxolitinib,
            antithymocyte globulin

- Chronic GVHD (typically after T+100)

    - Can involve all organs but typically see a scleroderma-like
        picture (xerophthalmia, xerostomia dysphagia, arthritis, skin
        changes, malar rash, obliterative bronchiolitis, cholestatic
        liver injury, cytopenias)

    - Treatment: steroids (also photophoresis for skin), consider
        trials of ruxolitinib, ibrutinib, rituximab if refractory

- PTLD (post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders)

    - Pathophysiology: B-cell proliferative disease typically 2/2
        > latent EBV

    - Symptoms: fever, weight loss, fatigue, lymphadenopathy,
        > extra-nodal masses, ↑ EBV PCR

CAR T-cell Therapy – Chelsie Sievers

Background

- Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) are a type of autologous
    T-cell therapy collected from the patient and genetically modified
    to contain an extracellular tumor-specific antigen target linked to
    the internal component of the T-cell receptor.

- Goal: patient's own T-cells can specifically target the tumor cell
    population.

- FDA approved therapies: Kymriah (CD19), Abecema (BCMA), Breyanzi
    (CD19), Tecartus (CD19), Yescarta (CD19)

Complications:

- Cytokine Release Syndrome

    - Pathophysiology: Supraphysiologic immune cell response with
        release of inflammatory cytokines.

        - Grade 1: fever ≥ 100.4, no hypotension, no hypoxia

        - Grade 2: fever ≥ 100.4, hypotension not requiring
            vasopressors and/or hypoxia requiring \< 6L

        - Grade 3: fever ≥ 100.4, hypotension requiring a vasopressor,
            hypoxia requiring \> 6L or non-rebreather

        - Grade 4: fever ≥ 100.4, hypotension requiring multiple
            vasopressors, hypoxia requiring positive pressure

Oncologic Emergencies – Madeleine Turcotte

Leukostasis

Presentation

- Primarily occurs with acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic
    leukemia. This is not common with CLL or CML with high leukocyte
    counts in the absence of a significant increased portion of
    peripheral blasts

- Respiratory: dyspnea, hypoxia (note CXR may be normal)

<!-- -->

- PaO2 by ABG often falsely low from WBC consuming O2 in vitro. Trust
    SpO2.

<!-- -->

- CNS: headache, AMS, vision changes, dizziness, tinnitus, gait
    instability, neuro deficit

Evaluation

- CBC with diff and peripheral blood smear

- Imaging: CT head to evaluate neuro deficit and to check for ICH

- Chest X-Ray vs CT chest to evaluate dyspnea and air space
    abnormalities

Management

- Call hematology

- Emergent cytoreduction

<!-- -->

- Leukapheresis: page nephrology and place dialysis catheter

<!-- -->

- Hydroxyurea and chemotherapy per hematology fellow

- Transfer/admit to ICU

Tumor Lysis Syndrome – Bradley Christensen

Background

- Lysis of malignant cells either spontaneously or in response to
    chemotherapy causing release of K, Phos, nucleic acids, and
    cytokines

- Consequences:

<!-- -->

- Hyperkalemia: most urgent and immediately life threatening

- Hyperphosphatemia: binds Ca and leads to CaPhos crystal deposition
    AKI, HypoCa

- Hyperuricemia (from breakdown of DNA) precipitation in renal tubules
    AKI

- Hypotension, AKI from cytokine release

<!-- -->

- Laboratory TLS

<!-- -->

- Uric acid ≥ 8, Ca2+ ≤ 7, K+, or PO43- ≥ 4.5

- OR \> 25% change from baseline in these values

Evaluation

- Risk Stratification:

<!-- -->

- Highest risk after starting chemotherapy, but can occur
    spontaneously

<!-- -->

- Tumor characteristics which confer a higher risk of developing TLS:

<!-- -->

- High (\>5% risk): ALL (WBC\> 100K or LDH 2x ULN), AML (WBC\> 100K),
    Burkitt’s (III/IV or LDH≥2xULN, DLBCL with bulky disease,
    intermediate risk + AKI/CKD

- Intermediate: ALL (WBC\<100K, LDH \<2x ULN), AML (WBC 25-100K),
    Burkitt’s LDH\<2x ULN), DLBCL (non-bulky, LDH\>ULN), CLL (if tx with
    fludarabine, rituximab, lenalidomide, or venetoclax +LN 5-10 cm or
    ALC≥25K), plasma cell leukemia, rare chemo-sensitive solid tumors
    (small cell)

- Low: all others

Management

- Prevention:

<!-- -->

- High risk: q6-8h TLS labs, IVF (±loop diuretic if volume overload),
    allopurinol, ± rasburicase

- Intermediate – q8h TLS labs, IVF, allopurinol

- Low – daily TLS labs, IVF

    - Significant hydration: goal to maintain UOP 80-100 mL/hr

    - Allopurinol: 300 mg PO BID for CrCl \> 20 mL/min, UpToDate renal
        dosing if lower

    - Rasburicase ($$$): contraindicated in G6PD (send G6PD if not
        urgent and AA, Asian or Jewish descent)

        - Given if uric acid \> 8 mg/dL: get fellow approval before
            ordering

<!-- -->

- Treatment: (Can use as night/cross cover handoff)

<!-- -->

- K+ \> 5.5: STAT EKG. Kayexalate 30g orally or 60g per rectum (unless
    contraindicated) x1

    - Give 10 U insulin/1 amp D50

    - If EKG changes, then calcium gluconate and D5W at 100 mL/hr with
        repeat BG in 1 hr

- Uric acid \> 8 with 25% change from baseline: page hematology fellow
    to discuss rasburicase

- PO4 \> 4.5 with 25% change from baseline: start/↑ phos binder
    (sevelamer)

- Dialysis may be necessary in patients with poor renal function.

- IV calcium: do not administer unless symptomatic AND
    hyperphosphatemia is corrected

    - With high phos, IV calcium can lead to calcium deposition and
        renal failure

- Hemodialysis: pt with anuria, refractory hyperkalemia, and
    symptomatic hypocalcemia

Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Syndrome

Background

- Commonly Associated Malignancies: Lung Cancer, Non-Hodgkin or
    Hodgkin Lymphoma, Mediastinal Germ Cell Tumors, Thymic Malignancies

- Partial or complete obstruction of the SVC impedes blood return from
    the upper extremities, head, neck, and brain resulting in upstream
    congestion

- Can be 2/2 a mass in the mediastinum or thrombosis (foreign body
    i.e. catheter)

Presentation

- Facial or neck swelling without generalized edema

- Sense of head fullness, exacerbated by leaning forward or lying down

- Pulmonary symptoms including dyspnea, stridor, hoarseness, cough -
    due to edema narrowing the nasal passages and larynx or mechanical
    airway obstruction

- Physical Exam: facial and neck edema particularly of the eye lids in
    the morning, distended neck and chest veins; can also sometimes see
    upper extremity swelling, papilledema, plethora. Look for associated
    lymph node enlargement anywhere particularly including
    supraclavicular, cervical, and axillary region

Evaluation

- CXR: may show mass, perihilar or mediastinal disease

- Contrasted CT scan ± CT Venography: Phased to get a view of clot
    contribution to obstruction guides decision regarding
    anticoagulation or stenting

<!-- -->

- Radiology attending can coordinate with techs (requires verbal
    direct request)

<!-- -->

- MRI/MRV may provide additional information (often not possible due
    to pt too sick)

Management

- Assess airway and prepare for intubation if needed

- Keep head of bed elevated

- Thrombosis:

<!-- -->

- Removal of lines/catheters associated with thrombus

- Consideration of anticoagulation

<!-- -->

- Tumor compression: the type of tumor guides treatment (tissue biopsy
    is key)

- Stat/urgent consultations:

<!-- -->

- Interventional radiology for possible stenting/dilatation

- Radiation oncology- for radiation therapy

- Interventional pulmonology – for help with tissue dx

- Medical oncology – for help with diagnosis and chemotherapy

Spinal Cord Compression

Background

- Malignancies where cord compression is most common:

<!-- -->

- Multiple Myeloma, Lymphoma (both Hodgkin and NHL), Lung, Breast,
    Prostate Cancer

<!-- -->

- Tumor mass & compressed and often displaced bone impinges thecal sac
    or nerve roots spinal cord or any spinal nerves including the cauda
    equina

Presentation

- Back pain, motor, or sensory deficits

- Cauda Equina syndrome bowel or bladder incontinence, ataxia

Evaluation

- Neurologic exam with sensation testing seeking level below an
    identified dermatome

- Lab testing: If no known malignancy check CBC, CMP, SPEP, and (in
    males) PSA

- Bladder US if suspicion or retention with or without overflow
    incontinence

Management

- If suspected, order MRI without and with contrast; if patient unable
    to have MRI, CT myelography may be considered

- Immediate high dose steroids (dosing is controversial with
    recommendations ranging from 4 to 100 mg of dexamethasone q6h -
    choice of dexamethasone is to minimize mineralocorticoid effects.
    Most common dosing is 10mg IV x1 followed by 4mg IV q6h)

- Consider stat/urgent consultation with:

<!-- -->

- Neurosurgery for diagnostic/therapeutic intervention

- Radiation oncology- for radiation therapy

- Medical oncology – for help with diagnosis and chemotherapy

<!-- -->

- Ensure regular neuro-vascular checks and close monitoring.

Brain Metastases

Background

- Common malignancies: Lung (NSCLC), breast, kidney, colorectal
    carcinomas & melanomas

- Significantly more common than primary brain tumors

- 80% of brain metastasis occur in the cerebrum at grey/white matter
    junction

    presyncope

- Seizures

- Stroke (particularly in melanoma, choriocarcinoma, thyroid & renal
    carcinomas)

Evaluation

- STAT CT if concerned for stroke or elevated ICP

- MRI with contrast: most sensitive, can differentiate between
    metastases vs. other lesions

<!-- -->

- Suggestive features: multiple lesions, location, circumscribed
    margins, vasogenic edema

<!-- -->

- If pt has no known primary tumor: consider CT C/A/P +/- PET to
    identify primary

- Biopsy with histopathology & IHC: if diagnosis in doubt or if only a
    single lesion is present

Management

- If severe HA, N/V, focal deficits: systemic glucocorticoids

<!-- -->

- Dexamethasone 10mg IV x1 followed by 4mg IV q6h (can be PO if
    tolerated)

<!-- -->

- Stat/urgent consults:

<!-- -->

- Neurosurgery – for diagnostic/therapeutic intervention

- Radiation oncology – for radiation therapy

- Medical oncology – for help with diagnosis and chemotherapy

<!-- -->

- Ensure regular neuro-vascular checks and close monitoring

- Do not perform LP without input from neurology

- NMDA-R can be ordered as a standalone test

- CT head

- EEG if concern for subclinical seizures

Management

- Consult Neurology, for possible immunosuppressive therapy (steroids,
    IVIG)

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS)

Background

Therapy Toxicities – Rahul Shah

Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Toxicities:

- Immune checkpoint inhibitors augment the endogenous immune response
    against tumors, which may lead to autoimmune-like toxicities, known
    as immune-related adverse events (irAEs)

- Treatment: low-dose glucocorticoids (prednisone, 0.5 mg/kg) for mild
    adverse events, high dose glucocorticoids (prednisone, 1-2 mg/kg)
    for severe adverse events
