Coagulopathies – Jason Jones

- Step one: determine if platelet vs coagulation disorder

- Platelet Disorders: Skin/mucous membrane bleeding; Petechiae; Often
    mild bleeding following surgery and tends to immediately follow
    surgery

- Coagulation defect: Bleeding deep in soft tissues (muscles/joints);
    hemarthroses, hematomas; tendency to have delayed bleeding after
    surgery that can be severe

- Coagulopathies can be divided into Hereditary vs Acquired causes

Hereditary

Hemophilia A (Factor VIII Deficiency) and Hemophilia B (Factor IX
Deficiency)

- Inherited in X-linked Recessive pattern

- Diagnosis: Isolated prolonged PTT with normalization upon mixing
    study

- Management: purified/recombinant Factor VIII or IX. Desmopressin for
    mild disease

- Consult benign hematology every time these patients are admitted

von Willebrand Disease (vWD)

- Can be hereditary (common) or acquired

- Abnormal quantity or function of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) needed
    for platelet function

- Type 1 (most common): Quantitative defect. Low quantity, normal
    function of vWF

- Type 2: Qualitative defect. Normal quantity, abnormal function of
    vWF.

- Type 3 (rare): Complete absence of vWF, phenotypically similar to
    hemophilia A

- Order in Epic: vW Profile = vWF Ag, Factor VIII Activity, Ristocetin
    Cofactor Activity

- Management: Desmopressin (DDAVP) can be useful as prophylaxis or
    treatment; most patients are treated with factor concentrate
    replacements

Acquired

Coagulation Factor Inhibitors

- Associated with autoimmune disease (paraneoplastic vs. autoantibody)

- Seen in hemophilia due to frequent treatments with recombinant
    factors (alloantibody)

- Diagnosis: Elevated PTT that does not normalize with mixing study

- Management: Immunosuppression with steroids; cyclophosphamide +/-
    rituximab

<!-- -->

- Consult Hematology always (rare disorder with major bleeding
    complications)

Vitamin K Deficiency

- Caused by malnutrition, liver disease, or iatrogenic with warfarin

- Diagnosis: elevated PT, if severe may have prolonged PTT as well

- Management: Replace vitamin K

Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) - Eric Singhi

Background

- Concurrent activation of the coagulation pathway and fibrinolytic
    pathway

<!-- -->

- Consumption of platelets, fibrin, and coagulation factors
    fibrinolysis end organ damage and hemolysis

<!-- -->

- Etiologies:

<!-- -->

- Infection/Sepsis, Liver disease, Pancreatitis, Trauma

- Malignancies: mucin-secreting pancreatic/gastric adenocarcinoma,
    brain tumors, prostate cancer, all acute leukemias, acute
    promyelocytic leukemia

- Obstetric complications (i.e. preeclampsia/eclampsia, placental
    abruption)

- Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (i.e. ABO incompatible
    transfusion)

Evaluation

- Exam: petechiae, bleeding (mucosal, IV site, surgical wound site,
    hematuria), ecchymoses, thrombosis (i.e. cold, pulseless
    extremities)

- CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, Fibrinogen, D-Dimer, Peripheral Blood Smear

- “DIC labs” = q6h fibrinogen, PT/INR, aPTT (space out when lower
    risk)

- Findings suggestive of DIC: thrombocytopenia, prolonged aPTT and
    PT/INR, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated D-dimer, fibrin degradation
    products, schistocytes

Management

- Treat the underlying cause!

- Vitamin K for INR \> 1.7 or bleeding

- Hypofibrinogenemia treatment: Cryoprecipitate 5-10 units if
    fibrinogen \< 100

- Thrombocytopenia treatment: plt transfusion as normally indicated

- DVT ppx if not bleeding and plt \> 50

- VTE: anticoagulation if plt \> 50 and no massive bleeding

Transfusion Medicine – R. Dixon Dorand

For emergent transfusions, call the blood bank (615-322-2233)

- RNs on 10T and 11N can follow transfusion protocols for pRBCs and
    Plts – enter as a Nursing Communication or as part of the
    Hematology/Oncology Admission Order set.

- At VUMC, all special processing of blood products (such as
    irradiation) will be decided by blood bank based on special
    considerations listed in order set. Examples include: stem cell
    transplant, hematologic malignancy, or thalassemia

- Patients with frequent transfusions (e.g. sickle cell
    hemoglobinopathy) should have an RBC Extended Phenotype ordered
    (once) for minor RBC antigens to avoid immunization and antibody
    development to these proteins

- You may ask the VUMC hematology lab to email you pictures of the
    peripheral smear

VA: Orders Tab – Blood Bank Orders – follow prompts to select
appropriate product. Must order both the blood product AND the
transfusion order (“Transfuse blood”)

- You need to specify all special processing such as irradiation

- To order a Type & Screen as a lab, you must go to Blood Bank Orders

- Type & Screen and Transfusion results are under the Blood tab in
    Results

Red Blood Cell Transfusion

- Volume 200-300 mL per unit prbc

- In general, 1 unit of packed RBCs increases Hgb by 1g/dL and HCT by
    \~3%

- Assessment of the post-transfusion Hgb can be performed 15 min
    following transfusion, but ideally 1 hour after completion

Indications:

- Hgb \<9-10 g/dL – Acute coronary syndrome

- Hgb \<8 g/dL or Hct \<25 – Bone marrow failure or receiving
    antineoplastic therapy

<!-- -->

- Also sometimes used in pts with pre-existing CAD

<!-- -->

- Hgb \<7 g/dL or Hct \<21 – ICU, GI Bleeding, Oncology patient on
    Treatment

Indications for Platelets

- \<11 k/µL – all patients, reduce risk of spontaneous hemorrhage (use
    on BMT, Brittingham)

- \<50 k/µL – active bleeding, scheduled to undergo select invasive
    procedure

- \<100 k/µL – CNS hemorrhage, intrathecal catheter

<!-- -->

- This is also the threshold used for most Neurosurgical procedures

Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) & Cryoprecipitate (Cryo)

Cryoprecipitate

- FFP enriched for von Willebrand factor, factor VIII, factor XIII,
    and fibrinogen

FFP

- Once thawed, must be used in 24 hrs (due to decline in labile
    coagulation factors)

- Must be ABO compatible but not crossmatched or Rh typing

- Only administer FFP if INR ≥1.7 (FFP will not fix an INR \< 1.7)

Indications for transfusion

- Bleeding:

<!-- -->

- FFP If INR \>1.7

- Cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen \<100.

<!-- -->

- DIC:

<!-- -->

- Fibrinogen \<100: Transfuse 5 – 10 units cryoprecipitate and repeat
    fibrinogen. If bleeding, consider raising transfusion threshold of
    cryoprecipitate to fibrinogen \<150

- For elevated INR, consider FFP transfusion. Thresholds for doing
    this vary by attending

<!-- -->

- Cirrhosis:

<!-- -->

- General concept: PT/INR, aPTT are unreliable markers for bleeding.
    Fibrinogen ≤100 – 120 or thromboelastography are better surrogates
    for bleeding risk

- Transfuse fibrinogen ≤100 – 120 if the patient is actively bleeding
    or about to undergo a procedure or surgery other than paracentesis

- Transfuse FFP based on hepatology team preference (generally few
    indications for FFP)

Transfusion Premedication & Reactions

- If you are concerned about a serious transfusion reaction, pause the
    transfusion and contact the blood bank asap

- Order the transfusion reaction blood testing in Epic. You will send
    a CBC, the bag of blood products, and the completed form to the
    blood bank for analysis

Premedication:

- Only if history of severe reaction

<!-- -->

- Diphenhydramine 25-50mg IV

- Acetaminophen 650 mg PO

- Meperidine 25-50 mg IV (optional for chills)

- Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV (optional, for severe reactions or reactions
    despite acetaminophen and diphenhydramine)

Sickle Cell Crisis – Michael J. Neuss

Background

- Present with severe pain in bone, joints, chest, abdomen

- Causes: (HIDISC) Hypoxia, Ischemia, Dehydration, Infection, Stress,
    Cold

- Can’t Miss:

<!-- -->

- Acute chest: hypoxia + fever + chest pain + new infiltrate on CXR
    (consult benign hematology immediately, do not wait until the next
    day)

- PE (ACS less likely in these patients); avascular necrosis of hip,
    priapism, stroke

Evaluation

- Labs: LDH (high), Hgb/Hct (low; check vs baseline), retic, smear,
    WBC

- If febrile: UA + Blood cultures

- Send Hgb S level, and compare to baseline w/ other hospital
    admissions

- Imaging: CXR, MRI for hip pain, Abdominal U/S or CT abdomen

- Maintain active type and cross given probability of antibodies

Management

- General:

<!-- -->

- Look for a care coordination yellow note in the Summary Tab

    - Heme clinic will have specific management preferences for
        individual patients

- Maintain hydration, IVF at 150-200 cc/hr (if no contraindication)

- Oxygen: goal sat \~95% (higher O2 goal will help to prevent further
    sickling!)

- Continue folic acid 1 mg qDay

- Continue hydroxyurea if uncomplicated pain crisis

    - Hold if counts suppressed or concern for infection

- If in the MICU: consider discussion for plasma exchange (if Hgb SS
    or SC or S-Thal)

- Transfuse: Simple transfusion if Hgb lower than baseline and/or
    complications

    - Avoid transfusions when able, given risk of antibody formation

<!-- -->

- Pain:

<!-- -->

- Will generally require opiates, likely initiation of PCA

- All SS patients should have pain plans; inpatient pain plans are in
    the problem list under sickle cell disease or in the care
    coordination section of Epic

- Outpatient plans (to which you will transition pts back prior to
    discharge) are not standardized in location, but can be under Media
    (with a pain contract) or found in notes

<!-- -->

- Acute chest:

<!-- -->

- Consult Hematology at time of admission

- D5 1/2 NS @ 150-250 cc/hr

- Transfuse hgb to \>10

- PCA w/ dilaudid

- Abx for CAP (vs HAP if risk factors) ± bronchodilators

<!-- -->

- Consider LP for NHL with high risk of CNS involvement or presence of
    neurological symptoms

<!-- -->

- Risk factors: Burkitt, Lymphoblastic, testicular involvement,
    double/triple hit

- Multiple LPs may be required to diagnose CNS lymphoma

<!-- -->

Myelodysplastic Syndromes – Peter Hanna

Background

- MDS is a malignant clonal myeloid disorder resulting in ineffective
    (dysplastic) hematopoiesis leading to peripheral cytopenia’s and a
    risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)

- Usually idiopathic, a disease of the elderly (median onset at age
    70)

- The WHO has several classification schemes for MDS

<!-- -->

- Most important for classification is the percent of blasts in the
    bone marrow

- Note \>20% blasts in marrow = AML. Thus MDS & AML are on a continuum

Presentation

- 50% asymptomatic; Symptoms can include nonspecific but gradual
    fatigue, weakness

- Dysplastic cells do not work properly infections and bleeding are
    more likely

- Macrocytic anemia is most common finding; followed by bicytopenia or
    pancytopenia

- Isolated neutropenia or thrombocytopenia are unusual but possible

- Ask about secondary causes:

<!-- -->

- Exposure to chemicals (benzene, crude oil/gasoline industry,
    cigarette smoke), chemotherapy, radiation

- Medications, alcohol use, chronic infections (HIV)

Evaluation

- Goal is to rule out reversible causes of dysplasia and cytopenias

- CBC w/differential, Peripheral Smear, B12, Folate, HIV

<!-- -->

- May consider Copper & Zinc (send out labs, are expensive and rare
    but check when MDS is being considered)

<!-- -->

- Dysplastic changes on peripheral smear: hypogranulated/hyposegmented
    neutrophils, hypogranulated platelets and macrocytosis of RBCs

<!-- -->

- Circulating myeloblasts can be seen

<!-- -->

- Final diagnosis made by Bone marrow Biopsy

Management

- Molecular characteristics define the “risk” of the disease and
    dictates treatments

- Prognostic scoring tools: revised international prognostic staging
    system (R-IPSS)

- Management general paradigm:

<!-- -->

- Asymptomatic: with low-risk disease = monitoring

- Low-risk disease + symptoms due to anemia only: transfusions,
    erythrocyte stimulating agents, and treatment with Luspatercept

- MDS with isolated del(5q): treated with lenalidomide

- High-risk patients: treated with hypomethylating agents

- Only curative intervention = hematopoietic stem cell transplant
    (HSCT)

Acute Leukemia – Robert Corty

Background

- Hematology malignant caused by unchecked proliferation of WBC
    precursors in the bone marrow

- Pt’s with suspected acute leukemia require hospitalization for
    urgent diagnosis & treatment

- Types:

<!-- -->

- AML = Acute Myeloid Leukemia

    - APL = Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia defined by translocation
        (15;17) PML-RARA

- ALL = Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia

<!-- -->

- Risk Factors:

<!-- -->

- radiation, chemical exposures (e.g benzene), chemotherapy (esp
    alkylating agents)

- HIV, immunosuppression, smoking

- myeloproliferative disorders, aplastic anemia

Presentation

- Leukocytosis, leukemia cutis, gingival hypertrophy, leukostasis

- Functional Leukopenia, often neutropenia: recurrent infections

- Anemia: fatigue, pallor, dyspnea

- Thrombocytopenia: gingival bleeding, epistaxis, petechiae,
    ecchymoses, menorrhagia

- Extramedullary hematopoiesis: splenomegaly, hepatomegaly,
    lymphadenopathy

Evaluation

- Diagnosis of acute leukemia requires one of the following:

<!-- -->

- 20% blasts in peripheral blood

- \> 20% blasts in bone marrow biopsy

- Any pathognomonic cytogenetic abnormality of t(8;21), inv(16),
    t(15;17)

<!-- -->

- Check for the presence of these time-sensitive conditions.

<!-- -->

- DIC – check fibrinogen, PT, PTT, platelets

- TLS – check uric acid, phosphate, K+

- Neutropenic fever – check temp, neutrophil count

- Leukostasis (see below)

- Presumptive APL – promyelocytes on diff, DIC or Auer rods on smear

<!-- -->

- Confirm if peripheral flow cytometry ordered/in process

- Use hematology admission order set

<!-- -->

- Set RBC and Plt transfusion thresholds

- Order nurse-driven electrolyte repletion

- ECG and TTE to establish pre-chemotherapy cardiac function

- Daily labs: CBC, TLS, DIC

- TLS prophylaxis

Management

- Consult hematology

<!-- -->

- Discuss chemo plan and order double lumen PICC for reliable access

- If findings suggest APL start ATRA

- Subspecialized lab tests: bone marrow biopsy, cytogenetics, FISH

<!-- -->

- Monitor for Common Complications/Emergencies: (see individual
    sections)

<!-- -->

- TLS, DIC, Febrile Neutropenia, Leukostasis

Additional Information

- Obtain blood product consent on admission

- APL Specific findings: promyelocytes on differential or Auer rods on
    smear

- Differentiation syndrome: promyelocytes differentiate

<!-- -->

- Symptoms and signs: fever, SOB, Hypotn, peripheral edema, pleural
    effusion, AKI

- Diagnosis: No defined criteria. If suspicious, discuss with
    hematology fellow

- Management: steroids. If critically ill, hold ATRA and ATO and
    consider hydroxyurea

Leukemia Treatment Overview

- General strategy is to use “induction” chemo to try to induce
    clinicopathologic (as opposed to molecular) “remission”

- Defined as absence of symptoms, normal CBC, and \< 5% blasts in bone
    marrow (on day 28)

- Then waiting in hospital until neutrophil count \> 500 (typically
    \~3 weeks)

- From there, bone marrow transplant (for high-risk disease) or
    “consolidation” chemo for normal-risk or low-risk disease

AML

- Induction

<!-- -->

- Typical is “7+3” i.e. idrarubicin on days 1-3 and cytarabine on days
    1-7

- If therapy-related AML, MDS-related AML, or AML with cytogenetics
    similar to MDS, use “Vyxeos” which is liposomal daunorubicin and
    cytarabine on days 1, 3, and 5

- If low-risk dz (t(8;21) or inv(16)), use cytarabine on days 1-7, and
    3 days of low-dose daunorubicin + gemtuzumab-ozogamicin

- There are other induction regimens that can be used depending on
    specific cytogenetics and patient frailty, which is beyond the scope
    of the handbook

<!-- -->

- Consolidation

<!-- -->

- Typically “HiDAC”(high-dose Ara-C i.e. cytarabine)

    - Generally too toxic for pts with age \> 60, so a dose reduction
        is used

- In the case of relapse, typical treatment is a different high-dose
    chemo and BMT if possible

ALL

- Typical induction is “HyperCVAD” (hyper-fractionated
    cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin (“A” due to trade name
    Adriamycin), and dexamethasone

- If t(9;22) (known as Philadelphia chromosome), use tyrosine kinase
    inhibitor (TKI)

- If CD20+, use rituximab

Plasma Cell Dyscrasias – Rahul Shah, Jennifer Marvin-Peek

Background

- A heterogenous group of benign, premalignant, and malignant
    conditions characterized by clonal proliferation of plasma cells

- Results in over-production of monoclonal immunoglobulins or
    polypeptides (i.e., M-protein) that can be detected in serum and/or
    urine

- Includes monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS),
    smoldering myeloma (SMM), multiple myeloma (MM), Waldenström
    Macroglobulinemia (WM), extra-medullary plasmacytoma, AL
    amyloidosis, POEMS syndrome

- Spectrum of MGUS, SMM, and MM represents natural progression of same
    disease process

- Complications: Increased infectious risk, cytopenias, renal failure,
    hyperviscosity syndrome, malignant hypercalcemia, pain crisis from
    bony disease

- Elevated gamma/protein gap (serum total protein minus albumin \>4)
    often prompts work-up for an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia (high
    specificity but low sensitivity)

- SPEP with immunofixation, UPEP (24-hour urine) with immunofixation,
    serum free light chains (FLC)

- Quantitative immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG, IgD, IgE)

- If Hgb \<10, Cr \>2, Ca \>11.5, M-protein \>1.5, non-IgG M-spike,
    abnormal FLC ratio:

<!-- -->

- Bone marrow biopsy + cytogenetics

- β2-microglobulin, serum viscosity (in WM)

- Skeletal imaging to identify bone lesions: skeletal survey (x-ray)
    often done initially, then more sensitive CT/PET-CT/MRI if biopsy
    shows SMM/MM

- If considering amyloidosis: abdominal wall fat pad biopsy with Congo
    red staining typically sufficient vs direct biopsy of
    amyloid-involved tissue

Multiple Myeloma

Evaluation

- Diagnosis requires clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥10% or
    bony/extramedullary plasmacytoma AND one or more end-organ event
    (CRAB criteria) or biomarker of myeloma

- CRAB criteria

    - Hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, bone osteolytic lesions

<!-- -->

- Biomarkers of multiple myeloma

    - Clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 60%

    - Serum FLC ratio ≥ 100 or ≤ 0.01

    - \>1 focal lesion ≥ 5mm on MRI

- Skeletal imaging: Whole-body PET-CT or CT preferred, MRI, bone
    survey (x-ray)

Management

- First-line induction therapy typically is RVd: immunomodulatory
    agent (lenalidomide \[<u>R</u>evlimid\]), proteasome inhibitor
    (bortezomib \[<u>V</u>elcade\]) and <u>d</u>examethasone

- Consolidation therapy includes autologous SCT for transplant
    eligible patients

- Maintenance therapy is often given indefinitely, typically
    lenalidomide or bortezomib

- Relapsed disease is often treated with anti-CD38 monoclonal Ab
    (daratumumab) with a steroid and either immunomodulatory drug or
    proteosome inhibitor; CAR-T also recently approved for relapsed MM

- Supportive Care

<!-- -->

- VTE prophylaxis with DOAC or LMWH if on an immunomodulatory agent
    > with 2 VTE risk factors; if only 0-1 VTE risk factors aspirin

<!-- -->

- EPO and G-CSF for treatment-related anemia and neutropenia

- Bisphosphonate (ideally zoledronic acid) to reduce risk of
    > fractures; analgesia ± radiotherapy for bone pain and palliation

- (Val)acyclovir if on bortezomib for VZV prophylaxis

Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma/Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (IgM)

Presentation

- Hyperviscosity syndrome: blurred vision, dizziness, diplopia,
    hypoxia, ataxia, vertigo, stroke, coma

- Peripheral neuropathy

- Retinal changes: dilated veins, hemorrhages, papilledema

- Cryoglobulinemia: large IgM complexes precipitate out in the cold,
    causing Raynaud's, urticaria, purpura, acral cyanosis, tissue
    necrosis

Evaluation

- Requires: IgM monoclonal gammopathy on SPEP, BM biopsy w/≥10%
    lymphocytes with plasmacytoid differentiation (late stage B-cell
    differentiation), and MYD88 mutation detected

- CBC, coagulation studies, cryoglobulins, IgM, β2-microglobulin

- Serum viscosity (If \<4 symptoms are rare, If \>6 typically
    symptomatic)

Management

- Asymptomatic patients managed with close observation

- Symptomatic hyperviscosity is treated with plasmapheresis

- Induction: may include bendamustine +/- rituximab if IgM level is
    \<4000 (Rituximab can temporarily ↑ IgM and ↑ risk of hyperviscosity
    syndrome)

- Monitor response with: IgM levels, monoclonal IgM on SPEP

Other Plasma Cell Dyscrasias

Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis

- Extracellular deposition of misfolded light chains (most commonly
    kidney & heart)

<!-- -->

- Features: nephrotic syndrome, restrictive CM, peripheral neuropathy,
    > HSM, macroglossia, easy bruising/bleeding,
    > dysautonomia/orthostasis

<!-- -->

- Diagnosis:

    - Need ALL 4: amyloid related systemic syndrome, positive congo
        > red staining on any tissue, evidence that amyloid is light
        > chain related, evidence of monoclonal plasma cell disorder

POEMS Syndrome

- Cause unknown, possibly chronic overproduction of pro-inflammatory
    cytokines such as VEGF

- Features: Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Monoclonal
    protein (usually λ light chain), Skin changes

- Diagnosis:

<!-- -->

- Mandatory Criteria: peripheral neuropathy, monoclonal plasma cell
    disorder

- Major Criteria (need 1/3): osteosclerotic lesions, VEGF, Castleman
    disease

- Minor Criteria (need 1/6): organomegaly, volume overload,
    endocrinopathy, skin changes, papilledema, thrombocytosis or
    polycythemia

Castleman Disease

- Angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia

- Antibodies to HHV-8 implicated in \>50% of cases

- Features: Lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats, fatigue, fluid
    accumulation, violaceous lymph node biopsy w/characteristic
    hematopathology papules

Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs) – Christina Snider

Background

- MPNs = chronic myeloid disorders caused by abnormal proliferation of
    mature bone marrow cell lineages (granulocytes, erythrocytes, or
    megakaryocytes)

- MPNs differ from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); cells in MPNs are
    normally developed (i.e. not dysplastic)

- Four “classic” MPNs: polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia,
    primary myelofibrosis and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)

Polycythemia Vera (PV)

Background

- Polycythemia is a general term: Men = Hb/Hct \> 16.5/49%; Women =
    Hb/Hct \> 16/48%

- Relative polycythemia = Concentrated H/H due to decreased plasma
    volume

<!-- -->

- Diuretic use, vomiting, diarrhea; H/H should normalize with fluid
    resuscitation

<!-- -->

- Absolute polycythemia = Increased RBC mass

<!-- -->

- Primary polycythemia: 2/2 Inherited/acquired mutation in RBC
    progenitor

- Secondary polycythemia: Increase in RBC mass due to elevated serum
    EPO

    - Hypoxia/cardiopulmonary associated (chronic pulmonary disease,
        R-to-L cardiac shunts, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation
        syndrome, chronic carbon monoxide poisoning, including heavy
        smoking)

    - Kidney associated causes (following renal transplant, renal
        artery stenosis, hydronephrosis)

    - Autonomous EPO production from an EPO-producing tumors (rare)

    - Steroid Use

<!-- -->

- Epidemiology: Median age of diagnosis is 60 years; 25% cases present
    at age \<50 years.

- \>95% PV pts have JAK2 V617F mutation, but JAK2 V617F mutation is
    not specific to PV and can be seen in other MPNs

Presentation

- Incidentally elevated H/H

- Splenomegaly, generalized pruritus (post-warm bath/shower), unusual
    thrombosis

- Erythromelalgia: intermittent occurrence of red, hot, painful
    extremities

Evaluation

- CBC with differential and peripheral smear

- EPO level

- Rule out secondary causes: Sleep Study, Carboxyhemoglobin, steroids

- Peripheral blood screen for JAK2 V617F mutation

Management

- PV treatment aims to prevent thrombosis and bleeding events.

- Phlebotomy: maintain Hct \<45% (One unit 500 mL decreases Hct by 3%)

- ASA 81 mg for thrombosis prevention and symptom control

- Hydroxyurea: indicated for high-risk patients (\>60 years old or
    with history of thrombosis)

- Interferon-alfa, busulfan, or ruxolitinib: indicated in select
    high-risk patients

Essential thrombocythemia (ET)

Background

- Clonal stem cell disorder w/ increased platelet counts (\>450k/uL)

- Risks of thrombosis and hemorrhage

- Median age of diagnosis: 60 years; Twice as common in females.

Presentation

- Incidental thrombocytosis on CBC

- Splenomegaly, unusual thrombosis, and erythromelalgia

Evaluation

- Screen for conditions that cause reactive thrombocytosis: Chronic
    inflammatory diseases, infections, bleeding/hemolysis, iron
    deficiency, post splenectomy

- CBC with smear (platelet anisocytosis) ranging from very small to
    giant platelets

- CMP, LDH, Uric Acid, iron studies

- BCR ABL1 testing should be sent to exclude CML

- Bone marrow biopsy with staining, cytogenetics, and molecular
    testing for JAK2, CALR, MPL mutations

Management

- Avoid ASA 81 in patients with platelet counts \>1 million
    complicated by acquired von Willebrand syndrome due to increased
    risk of bleeding

Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF)

Background

- Clonal proliferation of myeloid cells with variable morphologic
    maturity resulting in reactive marrow fibrosis and extramedullary
    hematopoiesis

- Least favorable prognosis out of MPN

Presentation

- Fatigue, weight loss, low grade fever, bone pain, and night sweats

- Marked splenomegaly +/-hepatomegaly (due to extramedullary
    hematopoiesis)

Evaluation

- smear: teardrop shaped RBCs (dacrocytes)

- Bone marrow biopsy: “dry tap” due to extensive reticulin and/or
    collagen fibrosis mutually exclusive mutations in JAK2, MPL, or CALR

Management

- Low risk patients: Observe if asymptomatic

- Cure by allogenic HCT transplantation in young, high-risk patients

- Treatment of anemias include transfusion support

- Surgical splenectomy if abdominal pain or transfusion dependent
    anemia (used very infrequently)

Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)

Background

- Definition: MPN characterized by the overproduction of myeloid stem
    cells that can differentiate

- Chronic phase:

<!-- -->

- Fatigue, weight loss, bleeding

- Abdominal fullness and early satiety due to splenomegaly

- WBC on CBC is typically \>100k, and smear shows neutrophilic cells
    in all stages of maturation with \<2% blasts

<!-- -->

- Accelerated phase: Refractory leukocytosis, 10-19% blasts in
    peripheral blood or bone marrow, worsening peripheral basophilia,
    thrombocytopenia

- Blast phase = acute leukemia. \>20% blasts in peripheral blood or
    bone marrow, extramedullary proliferation of blasts

Evaluation

- Typical findings in blood and bone marrow and confirmation of
    Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL1 fusion gene) via conventional
    cytogenetics, FISH, or rt-PCR

Management

- Hydroxyurea can be used to reduce WBC while awaiting confirmation

- Oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIS): Imatinib, dasatinib,
    nilotinib, and ponatinib

- Allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation: Curative option for
    pts in accelerated and blast phase, as well as young pts w/chronic
    phase CML who do not respond to TKI therapy

Bone Marrow Transplant – Chelsie Sievers

Background

- Donor selection

<!-- -->

- Autologous: self, no matching required (no GVHD risk, but also no
    graft-vs-tumor effect)

- Allogeneic: non-self, matching based on HLA (more matched = less
    GVHD risk)

    - Matched-related donor (MRD): fully matched sibling

    - Matched-unrelated donor (MUD): From NMDP database

    - Haploidentical: Half matched sibling or parent

<!-- -->

- Source of stem cells:

<!-- -->

- Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) vs bone marrow-derived cells vs
    umbilical cord

<!-- -->

- Conditioning regimens:

<!-- -->

- Myeloablative vs Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC)

<!-- -->

- GVHD prophylaxis (for allo-SCT):

<!-- -->

- Regimen varies, can include tacrolimus, MMF, MTX, or thymo and
    alemtuzumab during conditioning

    Complications/Adverse Effects:

<!-- -->

- Infectious

<!-- -->

- Neutropenic fever, neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis)

- Bacterial infections

- Viral infections

    - CMV: check weekly PCR levels post-allo-SCT

        - All CMV+ recipients are treated with letermovir
            prophylactically regardless of donor status

    - EBV: check weekly PCR levels post allo-SCT. If EBV VL \>1000 on
        two occasions, can treat with pre-emptive rituximab to reduce
        the risk of PTLD

- Invasive fungal infections (e.g. aspergillus, candida)

<!-- -->

- Non-infectious

<!-- -->

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, cytopenias

- Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD)/sinusoidal obstructive syndrome
    (SOS)

    - Pathophysiology: sinusoidal endothelial cell damage from
        conditioning chemo post-sinusoidal portal HTN cytokine release
        multiorgan failure and death

    - Diagnosis: T Bili \>2, hepatomegaly/RUQ pain, weight gain \>
        2-5%

    - Evaluation: RUQ US with doppler

    - Treatment: Per heme attending; generally supportive, consider
        defibrotide

- Graft failure:

    - Primary (persistent neutropenia without engraftment)

    - Secondary (delayed pancytopenia 2/2 immune phenomena or
        infection after engraftment)

- Engraftment syndrome:

    - Pathophysiology: PMN recovery cytokine storm vascular leak

    - Symptoms: fever, tachycardia, hypotension, SOB, pulmonary edema,
        rash, weight gain, bone pain, confusion

    - Diagnosis: Clinical

    - Treatment: high-dose IV steroids

- Acute GVHD:

    - Only in allogenic; Increased risk with more HLA mismatch

    - Pathophysiology: donor T cells attack recipient (Th1-mediated)

    - Symptoms: skin rash, cholestatic liver injury, diarrhea

    - Treatment: IV steroids (methylprednisolone 1-2mg/kg x 5d)

        - If refractory: mycophenolate, etanercept, ruxolitinib,
            antithymocyte globulin

- Chronic GVHD (typically after T+100)

    - Can involve all organs but typically see a scleroderma-like
        picture (xerophthalmia, xerostomia dysphagia, arthritis, skin
        changes, malar rash, obliterative bronchiolitis, cholestatic
        liver injury, cytopenias)

    - Treatment: steroids (also photophoresis for skin), consider
        trials of ruxolitinib, ibrutinib, rituximab if refractory

- PTLD (post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders)

    - Pathophysiology: B-cell proliferative disease typically 2/2
        > latent EBV

    - Symptoms: fever, weight loss, fatigue, lymphadenopathy,
        > extra-nodal masses, ↑ EBV PCR

CAR T-cell Therapy – Chelsie Sievers

Background

- Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) are a type of autologous
    T-cell therapy collected from the patient and genetically modified
    to contain an extracellular tumor-specific antigen target linked to
    the internal component of the T-cell receptor.

- Goal: patient's own T-cells can specifically target the tumor cell
    population.

- FDA approved therapies: Kymriah (CD19), Abecema (BCMA), Breyanzi
    (CD19), Tecartus (CD19), Yescarta (CD19)

Complications:

- Cytokine Release Syndrome

    - Pathophysiology: Supraphysiologic immune cell response with
        release of inflammatory cytokines.

        - Grade 1: fever ≥ 100.4, no hypotension, no hypoxia

        - Grade 2: fever ≥ 100.4, hypotension not requiring
            vasopressors and/or hypoxia requiring \< 6L

        - Grade 3: fever ≥ 100.4, hypotension requiring a vasopressor,
            hypoxia requiring \> 6L or non-rebreather

        - Grade 4: fever ≥ 100.4, hypotension requiring multiple
            vasopressors, hypoxia requiring positive pressure

    - Work-up: blood and urine cultures (IV abx if needed)

    - Treatment: acetaminophen for fever, ICU transfer (grade 1 okay
        for floor), Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg IV (max 800mg; up to 3 doses in
        24 hours, 8 hours apart), Dexamethasone 10 mg IV q 6 hours
        (grade 3-4).

- ICANS: Immune Effector Cell-Associated Neurotoxicity Syndrome

<!-- -->

- Pathophysiology: high systemic inflammation leaky blood brain
    barrier encephalopathy +/- cerebral edema.

    - Based on ICE score: Orientation: orientation to year, month,
        city, hospital: 4 points; Naming: ability to name 3 objects (eg,
        point to clock, pen, button): 3 points; Following commands:

Oncologic Emergencies – Madeleine Turcotte

Leukostasis

Presentation

- Primarily occurs with acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic
    leukemia. This is not common with CLL or CML with high leukocyte
    counts in the absence of a significant increased portion of
    peripheral blasts

- Respiratory: dyspnea, hypoxia (note CXR may be normal)

<!-- -->

- PaO2 by ABG often falsely low from WBC consuming O2 in vitro. Trust
    SpO2.

<!-- -->

- CNS: headache, AMS, vision changes, dizziness, tinnitus, gait
    instability, neuro deficit

Evaluation

- CBC with diff and peripheral blood smear

- Imaging: CT head to evaluate neuro deficit and to check for ICH

- Chest X-Ray vs CT chest to evaluate dyspnea and air space
    abnormalities

Management

- Call hematology

- Emergent cytoreduction

<!-- -->

- Leukapheresis: page nephrology and place dialysis catheter

<!-- -->

- Hydroxyurea and chemotherapy per hematology fellow

- Transfer/admit to ICU

Tumor Lysis Syndrome – Bradley Christensen

Background

- Lysis of malignant cells either spontaneously or in response to
    chemotherapy causing release of K, Phos, nucleic acids, and
    cytokines

- Consequences:

<!-- -->

- Hyperkalemia: most urgent and immediately life threatening

- Hyperphosphatemia: binds Ca and leads to CaPhos crystal deposition
    AKI, HypoCa

- Hyperuricemia (from breakdown of DNA) precipitation in renal tubules
    AKI

- Hypotension, AKI from cytokine release

<!-- -->

- Laboratory TLS

<!-- -->

- Uric acid ≥ 8, Ca2+ ≤ 7, K+, or PO43- ≥ 4.5

- OR \> 25% change from baseline in these values

Evaluation

- Risk Stratification:

<!-- -->

- Highest risk after starting chemotherapy, but can occur
    spontaneously

<!-- -->

- Tumor characteristics which confer a higher risk of developing TLS:

<!-- -->

- High (\>5% risk): ALL (WBC\> 100K or LDH 2x ULN), AML (WBC\> 100K),
    Burkitt’s (III/IV or LDH≥2xULN, DLBCL with bulky disease,
    intermediate risk + AKI/CKD

- Intermediate: ALL (WBC\<100K, LDH \<2x ULN), AML (WBC 25-100K),
    Burkitt’s LDH\<2x ULN), DLBCL (non-bulky, LDH\>ULN), CLL (if tx with
    fludarabine, rituximab, lenalidomide, or venetoclax +LN 5-10 cm or
    ALC≥25K), plasma cell leukemia, rare chemo-sensitive solid tumors
    (small cell)

- Low: all others

Management

- Prevention:

<!-- -->

- High risk: q6-8h TLS labs, IVF (±loop diuretic if volume overload),
    allopurinol, ± rasburicase

- Intermediate – q8h TLS labs, IVF, allopurinol

- Low – daily TLS labs, IVF

    - Significant hydration: goal to maintain UOP 80-100 mL/hr

    - Allopurinol: 300 mg PO BID for CrCl \> 20 mL/min, UpToDate renal
        dosing if lower

    - Rasburicase ($$$): contraindicated in G6PD (send G6PD if not
        urgent and AA, Asian or Jewish descent)

        - Given if uric acid \> 8 mg/dL: get fellow approval before
            ordering

<!-- -->

- Treatment: (Can use as night/cross cover handoff)

<!-- -->

- K+ \> 5.5: STAT EKG. Kayexalate 30g orally or 60g per rectum (unless
    contraindicated) x1

    - Give 10 U insulin/1 amp D50

    - If EKG changes, then calcium gluconate and D5W at 100 mL/hr with
        repeat BG in 1 hr

- Uric acid \> 8 with 25% change from baseline: page hematology fellow
    to discuss rasburicase

- PO4 \> 4.5 with 25% change from baseline: start/↑ phos binder
    (sevelamer)

- Dialysis may be necessary in patients with poor renal function.

- IV calcium: do not administer unless symptomatic AND
    hyperphosphatemia is corrected

    - With high phos, IV calcium can lead to calcium deposition and
        renal failure

- Hemodialysis: pt with anuria, refractory hyperkalemia, and
    symptomatic hypocalcemia

Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Syndrome

Background

- Commonly Associated Malignancies: Lung Cancer, Non-Hodgkin or
    Hodgkin Lymphoma, Mediastinal Germ Cell Tumors, Thymic Malignancies

- Partial or complete obstruction of the SVC impedes blood return from
    the upper extremities, head, neck, and brain resulting in upstream
    congestion

- Can be 2/2 a mass in the mediastinum or thrombosis (foreign body
    i.e. catheter)

Presentation

- Facial or neck swelling without generalized edema

- Sense of head fullness, exacerbated by leaning forward or lying down

- Pulmonary symptoms including dyspnea, stridor, hoarseness, cough -
    due to edema narrowing the nasal passages and larynx or mechanical
    airway obstruction

- Physical Exam: facial and neck edema particularly of the eye lids in
    the morning, distended neck and chest veins; can also sometimes see
    upper extremity swelling, papilledema, plethora. Look for associated
    lymph node enlargement anywhere particularly including
    supraclavicular, cervical, and axillary region

Evaluation

- CXR: may show mass, perihilar or mediastinal disease

- Contrasted CT scan ± CT Venography: Phased to get a view of clot
    contribution to obstruction guides decision regarding
    anticoagulation or stenting

<!-- -->

- Radiology attending can coordinate with techs (requires verbal
    direct request)

<!-- -->

- MRI/MRV may provide additional information (often not possible due
    to pt too sick)

Management

- Assess airway and prepare for intubation if needed

- Keep head of bed elevated

- Thrombosis:

<!-- -->

- Removal of lines/catheters associated with thrombus

- Consideration of anticoagulation

<!-- -->

- Tumor compression: the type of tumor guides treatment (tissue biopsy
    is key)

- Stat/urgent consultations:

<!-- -->

- Interventional radiology for possible stenting/dilatation

- Radiation oncology- for radiation therapy

- Interventional pulmonology – for help with tissue dx

- Medical oncology – for help with diagnosis and chemotherapy

Spinal Cord Compression

Background

- Malignancies where cord compression is most common:

<!-- -->

- Multiple Myeloma, Lymphoma (both Hodgkin and NHL), Lung, Breast,
    Prostate Cancer

<!-- -->

- Tumor mass & compressed and often displaced bone impinges thecal sac
    or nerve roots spinal cord or any spinal nerves including the cauda
    equina

Presentation

- Back pain, motor, or sensory deficits

- Cauda Equina syndrome bowel or bladder incontinence, ataxia

Evaluation

- Neurologic exam with sensation testing seeking level below an
    identified dermatome

- Lab testing: If no known malignancy check CBC, CMP, SPEP, and (in
    males) PSA

- Bladder US if suspicion or retention with or without overflow
    incontinence

Management

- If suspected, order MRI without and with contrast; if patient unable
    to have MRI, CT myelography may be considered

- Immediate high dose steroids (dosing is controversial with
    recommendations ranging from 4 to 100 mg of dexamethasone q6h -
    choice of dexamethasone is to minimize mineralocorticoid effects.
    Most common dosing is 10mg IV x1 followed by 4mg IV q6h)

- Consider stat/urgent consultation with:

<!-- -->

- Neurosurgery for diagnostic/therapeutic intervention

- Radiation oncology- for radiation therapy

- Medical oncology – for help with diagnosis and chemotherapy

<!-- -->

- Ensure regular neuro-vascular checks and close monitoring.

Brain Metastases

Background

- Common malignancies: Lung (NSCLC), breast, kidney, colorectal
    carcinomas & melanomas

- Significantly more common than primary brain tumors

- 80% of brain metastasis occur in the cerebrum at grey/white matter
    junction

Presentation

- Highly variable: consider brain mets in any cancer pt w/ neurologic
    or behavioral changes

- Headache: worse in the mornings, with bending over or with valsalva

- Nausea/vomiting

- Cognitive dysfunction: changes in memory, mood or personality

- Focal neurologic deficits

- Signs of elevated ICP: papilledema, vision changes, drowsiness,
    presyncope

- Seizures

- Stroke (particularly in melanoma, choriocarcinoma, thyroid & renal
    carcinomas)

Evaluation

- STAT CT if concerned for stroke or elevated ICP

- MRI with contrast: most sensitive, can differentiate between
    metastases vs. other lesions

<!-- -->

- Suggestive features: multiple lesions, location, circumscribed
    margins, vasogenic edema

<!-- -->

- If pt has no known primary tumor: consider CT C/A/P +/- PET to
    identify primary

- Biopsy with histopathology & IHC: if diagnosis in doubt or if only a
    single lesion is present

Management

- If severe HA, N/V, focal deficits: systemic glucocorticoids

<!-- -->

- Dexamethasone 10mg IV x1 followed by 4mg IV q6h (can be PO if
    tolerated)

<!-- -->

- Stat/urgent consults:

<!-- -->

- Neurosurgery – for diagnostic/therapeutic intervention

- Radiation oncology – for radiation therapy

- Medical oncology – for help with diagnosis and chemotherapy

<!-- -->

- Ensure regular neuro-vascular checks and close monitoring

- Do not perform LP without input from neurology

Paraneoplastic Syndromes – Justin Lo

Hypercalcemia of malignancy

Background

- Caused by PTHrP production, osteolytic lesions, and/or rarely
    exogenous Vit D

<!-- -->

- PTHrP: Breast cancer, NSCLC (squamous)

- Osteolysis: Multiple Myeloma, Breast Cancer;

- Exogenous Vit D: Lymphoma

Evaluation

- Correct \[Ca+2\] for hypoalbuminemia: add 0.8 x (4.0 – albumin)

- Send basic hyperCa+2 work-up – PTH, Vit D, etc. (see hypercalcemia
    section)

- PTHrP is called “Parathyroid Hormone-related Peptide-ARUP” in Epic

Management

- First-line: IVF without calcium such as Normosol; goal urinary
    output of 150-200 mL/hr

<!-- -->

- Strict I/Os; Cautious IV fluids if pt w/cardiac or renal dysfunction

- Add Furosemide if hypervolemic (do not empirically start)

<!-- -->

- Second-line: Zoledronic acid 4mg IV (takes 24-48 hours to see
    effect)

- AMS or severe hypercalcemia (\>14mg/dL): calcitonin 4 IU/kg (req.
    attending approval)

SIADH

Background

- Euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia with urine sodium \>20 and
    typically urine Osm \>100

- Associated with: SCLC (most common), head/neck cancers, breast
    cancer

- See "Nephrology" for additional information

Management

- Free water restriction to 800mL/day

- Refractory: salt supplementation (e.g. salt tabs) +/- loop diuretic

Carcinoid Syndrome

Background

- Episodic flushing, diarrhea, wheezing/SOB due to secretion of
    histamine & serotonin

- Most common: Neuroendocrine tumors – GI (often with mets to liver
    and lung)

Evaluation

- Urine: UR 5-HIAA (ARUP)

- Imaging to identify tumor(s) (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis)

Management

- Short-term treatment: subQ or IV octreotide (see UpToDate for
    dosing)

- Antidiarrheals (Imodium, Lomotil, etc.) to slow transit

- Long-term treatment: depot (IM) forms of octreotide and lanreotide

Autoimmune encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, and myelitis

Background

- Encephalopathy (limbic or brainstem), +/- myelitis (limb ataxia,
    sensory deficits)

- Associated with small cell lung cancer and checkpoint inhibitor
    therapy

Evaluation

- LP: make sure to order CSF oligoclonal bands & CSF IgG index

- “Paraneoplastic AutoAb Eval-MAYO” (add "CSF" to the front of the
    order name if for LP)

- NMDA-R can be ordered as a standalone test

- CT head

- EEG if concern for subclinical seizures

Management

- Consult Neurology, for possible immunosuppressive therapy (steroids,
    IVIG)

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS)

Background

- Muscle weakness due to autoantibody against calcium channels
    resulting in ↓ ACh release

- Associated with SCLC (most common) & lymphoma

Presentation:

- Proximal muscle weakness, diminished DTRs

Evaluation

- Nerve conduction studies: EMG w/ NCV

- Serum “Paraneoplastic AutoAb Eval-MAYO”

Management

Consult Neurology

Therapy Toxicities – Rahul Shah

Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Toxicities:

- Immune checkpoint inhibitors augment the endogenous immune response
    against tumors, which may lead to autoimmune-like toxicities, known
    as immune-related adverse events (irAEs)

- Treatment: low-dose glucocorticoids (prednisone, 0.5 mg/kg) for mild
    adverse events, high dose glucocorticoids (prednisone, 1-2 mg/kg)
    for severe adverse events
