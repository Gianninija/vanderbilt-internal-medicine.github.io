# Bleeding Coagulopathies

Hayley Hawkins

---

-	Bleeding tendency or dysfunction in clot formation can occur from either a quantitative or qualitative platelet defect, deficiency or inhibitor of coagulation factors, or compromise of vascular integrity 
-	Platelet disorders will present with mucocutaneous bleeding, petechiae, mild bleeding immediately following surgery, impaired wound healing
-	Coagulation defects will present with deep tissue bleeding in joints/muscles resulting in hemarthroses, hematomas, sometimes delayed but severe bleeding after surgery, and intracranial hemorrhage

## Qualitative or Quantitative Platelet Defects

- Thrombocytopenia: see "thrombocytopenia" section

### von Willebrand Disease (vWD)
- Most common inherited bleeding disorder, but can be secondary or acquired by other disease states
- Three types
    - Type 1 (most common): quantitative defect with normal vWF function
    - Type 2: qualitative defect with abnormal vWF function despite normal quantity
    - Type 3 (rare): complete absence of vWF, phenotypically similar to hemophilia A (vWF forms complex with factor VIII)
- Causes of acquired vWD
    - Lymphoproliferative disorders: CLL, NHL, plasma cell dyscrasias
    - Myeloproliferative disorders: PV, ET, or myelofibrosis
    - Autoimmune diseases: SLE
    - Sheer stress: aortic stenosis – Heidi syndrome, LVAD, ECMO
    - Hypothyroidism 
- Diagnosis:
    - “vW Profile” = vWF Ag, Factor VIII Activity, Ristocetin Cofactor Activity
- Management:
    - Major bleeding or major surgery: give VFW concentrate (some formulations have FVIII)
    - Minor bleeding or surgery or prophylaxis: DDAVP, TXA or aminocaproic acid in some circumstances

### Other causes of qualitative platelet defects
- Uremic platelet dysfunction
- Medications: NSAIDs, anti-platelets (ASA, Plavix), SSRIs (serotonin required for platelet activation), and melatonin (suggested by pre-clinical studies)

## Deficiency or Inhibitor of Coagulation Factors
### Hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) and hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency)
-	X-linked recessive inheritance
-	Frequently presents with hemarthroses and hematomas
-	Diagnosis: Isolated prolonged PTT with normalization upon mixing study
-	Management: Purified/recombinant Factor VIII or IX, mild disease can be managed with desmopressin, consult Benign Hematology on admission

### Acquired FVIII Inhibitor 
-	Onset in older age (60s) and frequently presents with significant intramuscular hematomas 
-	Disease associations in 50% of cases (other 50% idiopathic): autoimmune (e.g. SLE), malignancy (paraneoplastic), Pemphigus, drug-induced (e.g. interferon, penicillins), or chronic GvHD
-	Diagnosis: Elevated PTT that does not normalize with mixing study
-	Management:
    -	Always consult Hematology (rare disorder with major bleeding complications)
    -	Bleeding: Typically need a factor VIII bypassing agent (FEIBA)
    -	Immunosuppression: prednisone 1mg/kg, rituximab often also used front line

### Other Causes
-	Factor VIII deficiency: see vWD above 
-	Vitamin K deficiency
    -	Caused by malnutrition, liver disease (biliary obstruction), or iatrogenic with warfarin
    -	Diagnosis: elevated PT, prolonged PTT if severe, hepatic function panel
    -	Management:  IV vitamin K 10mg x 3 days
-	DIC and liver dysfunction/cirrhosis
    -	A FVIII level can help distinguish between the two (elevated or normal in liver dysfunction and decreased in DIC since it is not hepatically derived)
-	Amyloidosis: can cause factor X deficiency
-	Medications: warfarin, DOACs 

## Compromise of Vascular Integrity
-	Amyloidosis: can present as GI bleeding, purpura or ecchymoses (e.g. Raccoon eyes)
-	Vasculitis: purpura, alveolar hemorrhage (DAH), intracranial hemorrhage, GI bleeding 
-	Vitamin C deficiency: can present with bleeding gums, GI bleeding, ecchymoses, hematomas, anemia 
-	AVMs (fragile vessels that easily bleed)
-	Hereditary hemorrhagic Telangiectasia
    -	2nd most common inherited bleeding disorder
    -	Often presents with epistaxis, GI bleeding
    -	AVMs found in GI tract, lung (may cause shunting), liver (can contribute to cirrhosis), brain 
- vWD
    - von Willebrand multimers play direct role in modulating angiogenesis 
-	Heidi Syndrome: acquired vWD due to aortic stenosis, presents with GI bleeding from AVMs
