# Plasma Cell Dyscrasias

Rahul Shah, Jennifer Marvin-Peek

---

## Background
-	A heterogenous group of benign, premalignant, and malignant conditions characterized by clonal proliferation of plasma cells
-	Results in over-production of monoclonal immunoglobulins or polypeptides (e.g. M-protein) that can be detected in serum and/or urine
-	Includes monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), smoldering myeloma (SMM), multiple myeloma (MM), Waldenstrom’s macroglobulinemia (WM), extra-medullary plasmacytoma, AL amyloidosis, POEMS syndrome
-	Spectrum of MGUS, SMM, and MM represents natural progression of same disease process
-	Complications: increased infectious risk, cytopenias, renal failure, hyperviscosity syndrome, malignant hypercalcemia, pain crisis from bony disease
-	Elevated gamma/protein gap (serum total protein minus albumin >4) often prompts work-up for an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia (high specificity but low sensitivity)

## Evaluation
-	CBC w/ diff, peripheral blood smear, CMP (for Ca, Cr, albumin), LDH, CRP, urinalysis
-	SPEP with immunofixation, UPEP (24-hour urine) with immunofixation, serum free light chains (FLC)
-	Quantitative immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG, IgD, IgE)
-	If Hgb <10, Cr >2, Ca >11.5, M-protein >1.5, non-IgG M-spike, abnormal FLC ratio:
    -	Bone marrow biopsy + cytogenetics
    -	β2-microglobulin, serum viscosity (in WM)
    -	Skeletal imaging to identify bone lesions: skeletal survey (x-ray) often done initially, then more sensitive CT/PET-CT/MRI if biopsy shows SMM/MM
    -	If considering amyloidosis: abdominal wall fat pad biopsy with Congo red staining typically sufficient vs. direct biopsy of amyloid-involved tissue

## Multiple Myeloma
### Evaluation
-	Diagnosis requires clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥10% or bony/extramedullary plasmacytoma AND one or more end-organ event (CRAB criteria) or biomarker of myeloma
-	CRAB criteria
    -	Hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, bone osteolytic lesions
-	Biomarkers of multiple myeloma
    -	Clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 60%
    -	Serum FLC ratio ≥ 100 or ≤ 0.01
    -	&gt;1 focal lesion ≥ 5mm on MRI
    -	&gt;Skeletal imaging: whole-body PET-CT or CT preferred, MRI, bone survey (x-ray)

### Management
-	First-line induction therapy typically is RVd: immunomodulatory agent (lenalidomide [Revlimid]), proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib [Velcade]) and dexamethasone
-	Consolidation therapy includes autologous SCT for transplant eligible pts
-	Maintenance therapy is often given indefinitely, typically lenalidomide or bortezomib
-	Relapsed disease is often treated with anti-CD38 monoclonal Ab (daratumumab) with a steroid and either immunomodulatory drug or proteosome inhibitor; CAR-T also recently approved for relapsed MM
-	Supportive Care
    -	VTE prophylaxis with DOAC or LMWH if on an immunomodulatory agent with 2 VTE risk factors; if only 0-1 VTE risk factors à aspirin
    -	EPO and G-CSF for treatment-related anemia and neutropenia
    -	Bisphosphonate (ideally zoledronic acid) to reduce risk of fractures; analgesia ± radiotherapy for bone pain and palliation
    -	(Val)acyclovir if on bortezomib for VZV prophylaxis

## Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma/Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia (IgM)

### Presentation
-	Hyperviscosity syndrome: blurred vision, dizziness, diplopia, hypoxia, ataxia, vertigo, stroke, coma
-	Peripheral neuropathy
-	Retinal changes: dilated veins, hemorrhages, papilledema
-	Cryoglobulinemia: large IgM complexes precipitate out in the cold, causing Raynaud's, urticaria, purpura, acral cyanosis, tissue necrosis

### Evaluation
-	Requires: IgM monoclonal gammopathy on SPEP, BM biopsy with ≥10% lymphocytes with plasmacytoid differentiation (late stage B-cell differentiation), and MYD88 mutation 
-	CBC, coagulation studies, cryoglobulins, IgM, β2-microglobulin
-	Serum viscosity: If <4 symptoms are rare, If >6 typically symptomatic.
### Management
-	Asymptomatic pts managed with close observation
-	Symptomatic hyperviscosity is treated with plasmapheresis
-	Induction: may include bendamustine ± rituximab if IgM level is <4000 (rituximab can temporarily ↑ IgM and ↑ risk of hyperviscosity syndrome) 
-	Monitor response with: IgM levels, monoclonal IgM on SPEP

## Other Plasma Cell Dyscrasias
### Light Chain (AL) Amyloidosis
-	Extracellular deposition of misfolded light chains (most commonly kidney and heart)
    -	Features: nephrotic syndrome, restrictive cardiomyopathy, peripheral neuropathy, HSM, macroglossia, easy bruising/bleeding, dysautonomia/orthostasis
-	Diagnosis
    -	Need ALL 4: amyloid related systemic syndrome, positive congo red staining on any tissue, evidence that amyloid is light chain related, evidence of monoclonal plasma cell disorder

### POEMS Syndrome
-	Cause unknown, possibly chronic overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as VEGF
-	Features: Polyneuropathy, Organomegaly, Endocrinopathy, Monoclonal protein (usually λ light chain), Skin changes
-	Diagnosis:
    -	Mandatory criteria: peripheral neuropathy, monoclonal plasma cell disorder
    -	Major criteria (need 1/3): osteosclerotic lesions, VEGF, Castleman disease
    -	Minor criteria (need 1/6): organomegaly, volume overload, endocrinopathy, skin changes, papilledema, thrombocytosis or polycythemia

### Castleman Disease
-	Angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia
-	Antibodies to HHV-8 implicated in >50% of cases
-	Features: lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats, fatigue, fluid accumulation, violaceous lymph node biopsy w/characteristic hematopathology papules
