# Neutropenia & Neutropenic Fever

Jennifer Marvin-Peek

---

## Background
-	Neutropenia: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500
    -	Severe neutropenia: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) <500 (Use manual count if available)

## Management
-	If ANC <500
    -	Check all lines/IVs for erythema and induration daily
    -	Check mouth for mucositis, mouth care after meals and before bed
    -	Assess for Neutropenic Fever and Complications – see below
    -	Evaluate for indications for prophylaxis – see below
    -	No evidence to support use of neutropenic diet
    -	No digital rectal exams or enemas/suppositories (risk of bacterial translocation)

## Neutropenic Fever

### Definition
-	ANC <500 and T> 100.4 °F or 38.0 °C
-	Neutropenic pts are unable to mount an adequate immune response and can become critically ill very quickly
-	Do not wait for a temp re-check, you need to start antibiotics immediately

### Evaluation
-	Chest X-ray
-	Two sets of blood cultures (one from PICC/port if present)
-	Urinalysis AND urine culture (not the reflex order set)
-	If diarrhea, get C. diff PCR
-	If abdominal pain, get CT A/P with IV contrast

### Management
-	Empirically treat with cefepime 
-	Indications for vancomycin
    -	Hemodynamically unstable
    -	Severe mucositis
    -	Focal consolidation on CXR
    -	Erythema/induration around line
    -	Concern for skin/soft tissue infection
    -	GPCs in blood
    -	Fever continues >24h on cefepime
-	Additional Coverage:
    -	If abdominal pain/diarrhea: Flagyl 500mg q8h
    -	Concern for C-diff: PO vancomycin 125mg q6h
    -	Still fevering on cefepime at 72 hrs (differs by attending): meropenem 
-	Fungal coverage: consider if risk factors (TPN) or persistent fevers (>72hrs)
-	Micafungin 100 mg IV daily or voriconazole 200mg PO BID

## Neutropenic Complications

### Mucositis
-	Can range from mouth soreness to severe erosions preventing eating/drinking
-	Can become secondarily infected with Candida, HSV
    -	Management:
        -	Routine oral care with a soft toothbrush to remove plaque
        -	Oral rinses with saline and/or sodium bicarbonate
        -	Magic mouthwash for symptomatic relief (or viscous lidocaine at the VA)
        -	Typically recovers quickly when ANC > 500

### Neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis)
-	Life-threatening bacterial translocation due to breakdown of gut-mucosal barrier
-	Presentation: Abdominal pain + fever
    -	± abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, watery and/or bloody diarrhea
-	Diagnosis: CT A/P with contrast, consider C. diff PCR if diarrhea
-	Treatment
    -	Cefepime/Flagyl OR Zosyn
    -	If no perforation/abscess on CT scan, typically continue until 14 days after ANC recovers >500 and abdominal pain resolves
    -	Can change to cipro/flagyl once ANC >500
    -	If perforation/abscess: will need imaging to confirm resolution, and longer duration of abx

## Neutropenic Prophylaxis
-	Used if ANC is expected to be < 500 for > 7 days

### Filgrastim (G-CSF – Neupogen/Zarxio /Granix)
-	Induces bone marrow production of neutrophils
-	Dose: either 300mcg or 480mcg (rounded from 5 mcg/kg/day)
-	Common side effects: fatigue, nausea
-	PEG-filgrastim (Neulasta): long-acting version that is only given as an outpt
