# Cancer of Unknown Primary

Bailey DeCoursey

---

## Background 
-	Cancer of unknown primary (CUP) accounts for 2% of all cancer diagnoses 
-	Often, CUP is discovered incidentally on imaging tests or due to symptomatic metastasis 

## Presentation 
-	Asymptomatic and found on imaging 
-	Often generalized fatigue and weight loss 
-	May have irregular, persistent lymphadenopathy at a particular site 

## Initial Evaluation 
-	Physical exam: including pelvic / breast exam for females and prostate/testicular exam for males 
-	CMP, CBC w/ diff, UA, PSA in males, fecal occult blood screening 
-	CT C/A/P with contrast (reveals the origin in up to 35% of pts)
-	Once lesions are identified pt’s should undergo biopsy of the most accessible lesion 
-	If imaging is suggestive of GI origin, or pt has liver metastasis without other obvious dominant lesion, colonoscopy should be performed
    -	If physical exam with breast abnormalities, or pt has axillary lymphadenopathy, bilateral mammography should be performed
    -	Breast MRI may be considered even in the setting of negative mammography if clinical suspicion is high 

## Evaluation following biopsy 
-	Adenocarcinoma (70% of CUP)
    -	Most common primary:  pancreas, lung, liver, HPB tree, and kidney
    -	Interestingly, prostate and breast cancer account for a small percentage of CUP despite being the most common malignancies
    -	Most common metastasis: liver, lungs, lymph nodes and bones
    -	Evaluation:
        -	Primary is most likely to be identified by biopsy
        -	If clinical suspicion is high for certain primary site, this should be relayed to pathology so they may perform appropriate staining
        -	Tissue PSA can be positive even in the setting of normal serum PSA
        -	Serum studies such as CEA, CA19-9, CA 125, CA15-3 are often not sensitive or specific and will often be elevated in the setting of many types of adenocarcinoma 
-	Neuroendocrine tumors (1% of CUP)
    -	High grade
    -	Most common primary: lung (bronchogenic)
    -	Most common metastasis: mediastinal and retroperitoneal LN
    -	Evaluation: CT of chest ± bronchoscopy will likely identify site
    -	If unrevealing, IHC staining and molecular cancer classifying assays will likely be helpful 
-	Squamous cell carcinoma (5% of CUP)
    -	Work up depends on the location of adenopathy as follows:
        -	Upper and mid-cervical lymphadenopathy
            -	Most common primary: head and neck cancer
            -	Evaluation: CT head and neck, direct laryngoscopy, nasopharyngoscopy
        -	Lower cervical/supraclavicular lymphadenopathy
            -	Most common primary: lung or head and neck
            -	Evaluation: CT chest, CT head and neck, direct laryngoscopy as indicated
        -	Inguinal lymphadenopathy
            -	Most common primary: genital or anorectal origin
            -	Evaluation
            -	Females: careful external and internal genital examination
            -	Males: close external genital examination
            -	Anoscopy and DRE in all pt
-	In up to 60% of cases, a primary site may never be identified
-	Empiric chemotherapy may be initiated in consultation with medical oncology
