# Venous Thromboembolism

## Background
-	Includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and pulmonary embolism (PE). See “Pulmonary Embolism” section in cardiology for more information on PEs
-	Risk factors for provoked DVT/PE
    -	Major risk factors: major surgery >30 minutes, hospitalization > 3 days, C-section
    -	Minor Risk Factors: surgery <30 minutes, hospitalization <3 days, pregnancy, estrogen therapy, reduced mobility >3 days
-	Non-transient risk factors: malignancy (active), myeloproliferative disorders, IBD, liver disease, hereditary thrombophilia (factor V Leiden and prothrombin gene mutations most common), antiphospholipid syndrome. 

## Evaluation
-	Asymmetric calf swelling of >2cm sensitivity and specificity for DVT of 60-70% 
-	Wells’ Criteria for DVT can help guide diagnostic testing
    -	If a pt has a low pre-test probability, a negative D-dimer can rule out DVT
    -	In a high pre-test probability pt a negative D-dimer is less helpful
-	Whole-leg ultrasounds with doppler

## Management
-	Prophylaxis: Padua score
    -	Score > 4 high risk, recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis
        -	Subcutaneous Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) or Subcutaneous Heparin
    -	Score <4 is low risk; recommend ambulation and SCDs
-	Treatment (see anticoagulation section)
    -	Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH, twice a day dosing)
    -	Oral factor Xa inhibitors: rivaroxaban, apixaban
    -	Intravenous unfractionated heparin
    -	Warfarin (with bridge therapy)
-	Duration of treatment
    -	Provoked: 3-6 months or until provoking factor (trauma, surgery, malignancy) is removed
    -	Unprovoked: typically requires life-long anticoagulation along with assistance from hematology
-	Anticoagulation in malignancy
    -	LMWH or DOAC (most evidence for apixaban and rivaroxaban) while malignancy still active
    -	Avoid Rivaroxaban and Edoxaban in GI malignancies (increased rates of bleeding)
        -	Note – in Anti-phospholipid syndrome, can only use warfarin

## Additional Information
-	Should we get a follow up ultrasound?
    -	A follow up ultrasound at the CONCLUSION of anticoagulation can help establish a post-treatment baseline and provide a baseline study for future comparison that can be critical for the diagnosis of recurrent/new DVT (which is very difficult to determine radiographically without a comparison imaging study)
-	What about IVC filters?
    -	Select circumstances for these: In pts with acute DVT or PE and in whom anti-coagulation is absolutely contraindicated (thrombocytopenia, recent intra-cranial bleed, recent GI bleed) placement of a retrievable IVC filter should be discussed with Hematology and IR
