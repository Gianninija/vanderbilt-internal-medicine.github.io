# Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC)

## Background
-	Concurrent activation of the coagulation pathway and fibrinolytic pathway
    -	Consumption of platelets, fibrin, and coagulation factors à fibrinolysis à end organ damage and hemolysis
-	Etiologies:
    -	Infection/sepsis, liver disease, pancreatitis, trauma
    -	Malignancies: mucin-secreting pancreatic/gastric adenocarcinoma, brain tumors, prostate cancer, all acute leukemias, acute promyelocytic leukemia
    -	Obstetric complications: preeclampsia/eclampsia, placental abruption
    -	Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (e.g. ABO incompatible transfusion) 

## Evaluation 
-	Exam:  petechiae, bleeding (mucosal, IV site, surgical wound site, hematuria), ecchymoses, thrombosis (i.e. cold, pulseless extremities) 
-	Laboratory evaluation
-	CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, d-dimer, peripheral blood smear
-	“DIC labs”: q6h fibrinogen, PT/INR, aPTT (space out when lower risk)
-	Findings suggestive of DIC: thrombocytopenia, prolonged aPTT and PT/INR, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated D-dimer, fibrin degradation products, schistocytes
-	A FVIII level can help distinguish between the DIC and liver dysfunction: elevated or normal in liver dysfunction and decreased in DIC since it is not hepatically derived

## Management
-	Treat the underlying cause
-	Vitamin K for INR > 1.7 or bleeding
-	Hypofibrinogenemia treatment: Cryoprecipitate 5-10 units if fibrinogen < 100
-	Thrombocytopenia treatment: platelet transfusion as normally indicated
-	DVT ppx if not bleeding and platelet > 50
-	VTE: anticoagulation if platelet > 50 and no massive bleeding
