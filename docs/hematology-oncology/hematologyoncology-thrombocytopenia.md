# Thrombocytopenia

## Background
- Classified as either mild (100K-150K), moderate (50K-99K), or severe (<50K)
- Can be divided into different causes
    - Decreased platelet production
        - Decreased TPO: Cirrhosis
        - Bone marrow suppression: sepsis, EtOH, infections (HIV, tick-borne [RMSF, anaplasma, erhlichia], leptospirosis, parvovirus aplastic crisis), certain drugs (vancomycin, linezolid, bactrim, valganciclovir, immunosuppressive therapies, chemotherapies, allopurinol, colchicine)
        - Bone marrow failure
        - Infiltrative: malignancies (leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, metastatic solid tumors), infections (TB, NTM, fungal infections), fibrosis (myelofibrosis)
        - Aplastic anemia
        - Nutrient deficiencies: Copper (primary or caused by elevated zinc levels), B12, folate
    - Platelet destruction/consumption:
        - Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP):
        - Drug-induced (quinines, sulfonamides, beta-lactams, vancomycin, meropenem, valacyclovir, PPIs, H2 blockers, anti MTB therapy)
        - Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia
        - Infections (HIV, HBV, HCV, CMV, EBV, malaria, H. pylori)
        - Autoimmune disorders (SLE, scleroderma)
        - Thyroid disease
        - Bleeding
        - Idiopathic
        - Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs)
        - TTP (acquired, hereditary)
        - HUS
        - DIC (sepsis, APML, pancreatitis, transfusion reaction, HELLP)
        - Drug-induced (Calcineurin inhibitors, gemcitabine, cocaine)
        - Autoimmune (scleroderma renal crisis)
        - Complement-mediated (atypical HUS)
        - Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (APLS)
        - Hypertensive emergency
    - Sequestration: Hypersplenism or splenic sequestration (e.g. cirrhosis)
    - Pseudothrombocytopenia: platelet clumping
    - Dilutional: gestational thrombocytopenia 

## Presentation
- Usually asymptomatic
- Bleeding due to low platelet counts presents as petechiae
- Some causes of thrombocytopenia have a paradoxical increased risk of thrombosis (HIT, DIC, TMA, VITT from the AstraZeneca or Johnson & Johnson COVID vaccines)

## Evaluation
- Repeat CBC w/ diff PLUS a peripheral smear
- Citrated platelet count (to rule out pseudothrombocytopenia though a smear without clumping is sufficient to exclude this) and immature platelet fraction (IPF)
- IPF can help differentiate between decreased platelet production vs. increased platelet production (in setting of destruction/consumption)
- Medication reconciliation to look for any offending drugs
- TMA/DIC labs: Haptoglobin, LDH, LFTs, PT/PTT, fibrinogen, peripheral smear
- Viral serologies: HIV, HBV, HCV, EBV, CMV, parvovirus (if clinically indicated)
- Infectious work-up
- Sepsis: blood cultures
- Fungal work-up (if clinically indicated): 1,3-Beta-D-Glucan, aspergillus galactomannan, urine blasto Ag, urine and serum histo Ag, crypto Ag
- Tick-borne (if clinically indicated): RMSF, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma
- Leptospirosis (if clinically indicated)
- TB and/or NTM (if clinically indicated): AFB, interferon-Gamma release assay
- Autoimmune work-up (if clinically indicated): ESR, CRP, ANA w/ reflex, RF
- Nutritional studies: B12, folate, copper, zinc
- TSH to screen for thyroid disease
- Abdominal U/S to look for splenomegaly (or review recent imaging)
- Bone marrow biopsy (if clinically indicated): co-existing cytopenias raise suspicion for bone marrow involvement (particularly if present prior to admission)
- HIT work-up: Calculate 4T score: if 4+, order HIT Ab ELISA. If (+), serotonin-release assay (SRA) will reflex for confirmation 

## Management: 
- Platelet transfusion indications
    - CNS or ocular bleeding: <100K
    - Pt actively bleeding or plan for OR: <50K
    - Plan for central line, bronch, LP, diagnostic endoscopy, or bone marrow biopsy: <20K
    - Afebrile, hospitalized pts: <10K
- HIT management: Stop any heparin product and start argatroban.
- Schistocytes on smear:
    - Think TTP or DIC when there are schistocytes on smear and thrombocytopenia
    - If DIC is excluded, consult Hematology to discuss sending ADAMTS13 and starting PLEX. A Vascath is needed for PLEX
