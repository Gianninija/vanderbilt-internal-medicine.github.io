## Background
-	MPNs: chronic myeloid disorders caused by abnormal proliferation of mature bone marrow cell lineages (granulocytes, erythrocytes, or megakaryocytes)
-	MPNs differ from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); cells in MPNs are normally developed (i.e. not dysplastic)
-	Four “classic” MPNs: polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, primary myelofibrosis and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)

## Polycythemia Vera
### Background
-	Polycythemia is a general term: Men = Hb/Hct > 16.5/49%;  Women = Hb/Hct > 16/48%
-	Relative polycythemia: concentrated H/H due to decreased plasma volume
    -	Diuretic use, vomiting, diarrhea;  H/H should normalize with fluid resuscitation 
-	Absolute polycythemia: increased RBC mass
    -	Primary polycythemia: inherited/acquired mutation in RBC progenitor
    -	Secondary polycythemia: increase in RBC mass due to elevated serum EPO
        -	Hypoxia/cardiopulmonary associated (chronic pulmonary disease, R-to-L cardiac shunts, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, chronic carbon monoxide poisoning, including heavy smoking)
        -	Kidney associated causes (following renal transplant, renal artery stenosis, hydronephrosis)
        -	Autonomous EPO production from an EPO-producing tumors (rare)
        -	Steroid Use
-	Epidemiology: Median age of diagnosis is 60 years; 25% cases present at age <50 years.
-	&gt;95% PV pts have JAK2 V617F mutation, but JAK2 V617F mutation is not specific to PV and can be seen in other MPNs

### Presentation
-	Incidentally elevated H/H 
-	Splenomegaly, generalized pruritus (post-warm bath/shower), unusual thrombosis
-	Erythromelalgia: intermittent occurrence of red, hot, painful extremities 

### Evaluation
-	CBC w/ diff and peripheral smear
-	EPO level
-	Rule out secondary causes: sleep study, carboxyhemoglobin, steroids
-	Peripheral blood screen for JAK2 V617F mutation

### Management
-	PV treatment aims to prevent thrombosis and bleeding events.  
-	Phlebotomy: maintain Hct <45% (one unit 500 mL decreases Hct by 3%)
-	ASA 81 mg for thrombosis prevention and symptom control
-	Hydroxyurea: indicated for high-risk pts (>60 years old or with history of thrombosis)
-	Interferon-alfa, busulfan, or ruxolitinib: indicated in select high-risk pts 

## Essential Thrombocythemia (ET)
### Background
-	Clonal stem cell disorder with increased platelet counts (>450k/uL) 
-	Risks of thrombosis and hemorrhage
-	Median age of diagnosis: 60 years. Twice as common in females.

### Presentation
-	Incidental thrombocytosis on CBC
-	Splenomegaly, unusual thrombosis, and erythromelalgia 

### Evaluation
-	Screen for conditions that cause reactive thrombocytosis: chronic inflammatory diseases, infections, bleeding/hemolysis, iron deficiency, post splenectomy
-	CBC with smear (platelet anisocytosis) ranging from very small to giant platelets
-	CMP, LDH, uric acid, iron studies 
-	BCR ABL1 testing should be sent to exclude CML
-	Bone marrow bx with staining, cytogenetics, and molecular testing for JAK2, CALR, MPL mutations

### Management
-	Avoid ASA 81 in pts with platelet counts >1 million complicated by acquired von Willebrand syndrome due to increased risk of bleeding

## Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF)
### Background
-	Clonal proliferation of myeloid cells with variable morphologic maturity resulting in reactive marrow fibrosis and extramedullary hematopoiesis
-	Least favorable prognosis out of MPN

### Presentation
-	Fatigue, weight loss, low grade fever, bone pain, and night sweats
-	Marked splenomegaly ±hepatomegaly (due to extramedullary hematopoiesis)

### Evaluation
-	Smear: teardrop shaped RBCs (dacrocytes)
-	Bone marrow biopsy: “dry tap” due to extensive reticulin and/or collagen fibrosis mutually exclusive mutations in JAK2, MPL, or CALR
### Management
-	Low risk pts: observe if asymptomatic
-	Cure by allogenic HCT transplantation in young, high-risk pts
-	Treatment of anemias include transfusion support 
-	Surgical splenectomy if abdominal pain or transfusion dependent anemia (used very infrequently)

## Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)
### Background
-	Definition: MPN characterized by the overproduction of myeloid stem cells that can differentiate
-	Chronic phase:
    -	Fatigue, weight loss, bleeding
    -	Abdominal fullness and early satiety due to splenomegaly
    -	WBC typically >100k. Smear shows neutrophilic cells in all stages of maturation with <2% blasts
-	Accelerated phase: Refractory leukocytosis, 10-19% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow, worsening peripheral basophilia, thrombocytopenia
-	Blast phase = acute leukemia: >20% blasts in peripheral blood or bone marrow, extramedullary proliferation of blasts

### Evaluation
-	Typical findings in blood and bone marrow and confirmation of Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL1 fusion gene) via conventional cytogenetics, FISH, or rt-PCR

### Management
-	Hydroxyurea can be used to reduce WBC while awaiting confirmation
-	Oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI): Imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib, and ponatinib
-	Allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation: curative option for pts in accelerated and blast phase, as well as young pts with chronic phase CML who do not respond to TKI therapy
