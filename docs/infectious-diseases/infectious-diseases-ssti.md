# Skin and Soft Tissue Infection (SSTI) - VASP

---

## Cellulitis

See SSTI algorithm on VASP website

### Background
-	DDx: erysipelas, pyomyositis, necrotizing fasciitis, osteomyelitis, venous stasis, shingles, gout
-	Pathogens: Streptococcus species: Group A (most common), B, C, G, Staphylococcus aureus (including MSSA and MRSA)
    -	Non-purulent, lymphangitis, or erysipelas? Think Streptococcus
    -	Purulence (abscess or boil)? Think Staphylococcus
    -	Strep anginosus is a strep species that can cause pus formation
-	Unique clinical scenarios and associated organisms/organisms to consider:
    -	Dog/cat bite: Pasteurella multicoda, Capnocytophaga canimorsus
    -	Human bite: Eikenella corrodens, oral anaerobes, S. aureus
    -	Fresh water exposure: Aeromonas hydropholia, Plesiomonas shigelloides
    -	Salt water exposure: Vibrio vulnificus
    -	Neutropenia, presence of ecthyma: Gram negatives (Pseudomonas aeruginosa)
    -	Immunocompromised: Fungal (Candida spp, Cryptococcus), Nocardia, non-tubercular mycobacteria)
    -	Burn pts: Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Fusarium

### Evaluation
-	Outline border of erythema and obtain urgent surgery consultation if rapid spread of infection, crepitus, air in tissues, or pain out of proportion to exam
-	Blood cultures (BCx): ONLY needed if systemic signs of infection or immunocompromised (most pts will not need BCx or imaging)
-	US for underlying abscess 
-	CT/MRI w/contrast: if necrotizing fasciitis, pyomyositis or osteomyelitis suspected
-	Bilateral lower extremity cellulitis is RARE and warrants  consideration of non-infectious etiologies
-	Elevation test: if erythema improves after elevating leg above the level of the heart for 1-2 minutes, less likely to be infectious cellulitis 

### Management
-	Abx for 5 days for uncomplicated; can extend to 10-14 days if little to no improvement, more extensive/serious infection, or if immunosuppressed
-	Typically improvement is not seen until >48 hours of antibiotics, usually longer
-	Provide anti-Staphylococcal antibiotics for purulent cellulitis in addition to I&D, if abscess present
-	Clinical appearance may often appear to worsen initially despite adequate therapy
-	Always elevate the extremity for more rapid clinical improvement!

## Necrotizing Fasciitis

### Background 
-	Infection of the deeper soft tissues that causes necrosis along the muscle fascia and overlying subcutaneous fat that is rapidly progressive and lethal if not addressed
-	Clinical cues include rapid spread, pain out of proportion to exam, crepitus and hemorrhagic bullae
-	LRINEC score used to screen for necrotizing soft tissue infection

### Evaluation/Management
-	SURGICAL EMERGENCY!
    -	STAT consult to surgical service for emergent debridement (generally EGS vs ortho)
    -	Imaging does NOT rule out necrotizing fasciitis and should not delay these consultations
    -	CT is the best imaging modality
-	ID consult
-	Empiric antibiotics
    -	Preferred: linezolid 600 mg IV BID + piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375g IV q8h extended infusion
    -	For severe penicillin allergy: linezolid 600 mg IV BID + cefepime 2g IV q8h + metronidazole 500 mg IV BID
    -	For severe penicillin and cephalosporin allergy: linezolid 600 mg IV BID + levofloxacin 750 mg IV q24h + metronidazole 500 mg IV BID
    -	If patient cannot receive linezolid due to allergies, or multiple serotonergic drug interactions: vancomycin + piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375g IV q8h extended infusion + clindamycin 900mg IV q8h
