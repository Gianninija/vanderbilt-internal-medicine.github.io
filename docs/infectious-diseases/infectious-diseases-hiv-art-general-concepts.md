# HIV/AIDS and ART 

Kathryn Snyder and Quinton Taylor

## Background
-	New HIV Diagnosis
    -	ID consult if pt is not on Rogers ID service (important for initiation, follow up [CCC], social work assistance)
    -	ART is indicated for all HIV+ pts, regardless of CD4; however, starting ART requires appropriate outpt follow up
    -	Lab evaluation
        -	HIV viral load and genotype
        -	T cell subsets (CD4 Count), CBC with differential, CMP, UA
        -	HLA*B5701 testing before using abacavir containing regimen
        -	QuantiFERON Gold
        -	Pregnancy testing
        -	Viral hepatitis serologies
        -	Toxoplasma serologies
        -	CMP, CBC with differential, urinalysis
        -	Other STI screening (Syphilis, Gonorrhea/Chlamydia)
-	Timing of ART initiation
    -	Factors affecting timing of initiation
        -	Drug toxicity and interactions, risks for resistance, adherence barriers
        -	Treatment of opportunistic infections may delay initiation of ART given associated risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)
-	Delay ART for several weeks after initiation of therapy for cryptococcal meningitis, tuberculosis, and CMV retinitis
-	IRIS is a collection of inflammatory disorders associated with paradoxical worsening of preexisting infectious processes following the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV-infected individuals. Symptoms are associated with underlying disease. 
-	ART plan for overnight admits: okay to continue home ART, special consideration for:
    -	Pts with hepatic or renal dysfunction may need dose adjustment
    -	Interactions with other newly initiated medications
    -	If there is concern for non-adherence, can hold morning dose
    -	Combination pills may need to be ordered as separate components
    -	Close attention to medication reconciliation to ensure the pt’s complete ART regimen is ordered
-	Common key regimens for initiation
    -	Most regimens consist of an NRTI backbone (2 agents) plus a 3rd agent
    -	Some dual therapy regimens (such as Dovato@) are non-inferior to standard 3-drug therapy
    -	Many pts are started on combination pill regimens, including Integrase Inhibitor based regimens: Biktarvy®, Dovato®, Triumeq®, Genvoya®, dolutegravir + Descovy®
