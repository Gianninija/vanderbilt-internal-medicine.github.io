# Diabetic Foot Infection – VASP

## Foundational Principles
-	Do NOT use antibiotics to treat uninfected wounds as patient harm outweighs benefit.
-	ALL wounds are colonized with microorganisms and superficial wound cultures should not be collected nor used to make treatment decisions.
-	Do NOT administer antibiotics to clinically stable patients until deep tissue or operative cultures are obtained.
-	Failure of oral antibiotics used for < 48 hours is NOT a reason to use broad-spectrum antibiotics.

## Evaluation 
-	Plain radiograph for all pts; MRI w/contrast if abscess/osteo suspected 
-	Use of inflammatory markers such as ESR or CRP at baseline may help determine level of inflammation with periodic trending (e.g. weekly) thereafter. Do NOT repeat these tests daily.
-	BCx (prior to antibiotics) if systemic signs of infection, or severe infection
    -	Do not culture superficial swabs of lesions, as these generally only grow colonizing organisms.
-	Consider obtaining MRSA nasal PCR. (ensure collected before nasal decolonization); ~90% negative predictive values for diabetic foot infections
-	Consult podiatry if osteomyelitis present for bone specimen culture and pathology (either from debridement specimen or bone biopsy) prior to starting antibiotics. 
-	Consult surgery if concern for abscess, gas in tissue, joint involvement
-	Assess peripheral vasculature, consider arterial flow studies/vascular surgery consult

## Management
-	Assess Severity:
    -	Mild: local infection, skin/subcutaneous tissue only, erythema >0.5 cm but ≤2cm from ulcer
    -	Moderate: local infection w/erythema > 2 cm from ulcer or deeper structures included without SIRS
    -	Severe: local infection with systemic inflammation as evidenced by >2 SIRS criteria 
-	Consider anti-pseudomonal coverage only if at risk for Pseudomonas infection (e.g. previous Pseudomonas on culture, water exposure; hospitalization within previous 90 days AND IV antibiotic use, immunocompromise). 
-	Consider MRSA coverage with risk factors: previous MRSA on cultures, hospitalization within previous 90 days AND IV antibiotic use, IV drug use, hemodialysis
-	Consider anaerobic coverage with metronidazole

## Conversion to PO antibiotics (including osteomyelitis):
-	Active agent available
-	Functioning GI tract
-	Clinically stable
-	Select active agent(s) against recovered pathogen(s)

## Additional Information 
-	If pt HDS, hold abx until deep tissue/operative cultures obtained.
-	Most diabetic foot infections are polymicrobial in nature.
-	Culture results will help therapy, but all pathogens identified may not require treatment. Would discuss with ID if complex
