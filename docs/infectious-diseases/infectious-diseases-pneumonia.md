# Acute Bronchitis

## Background

- 1-3 wks productive cough, often preceded by URI, may have wheezing/rhonchi
- Distinct from chronic bronchitis (>3 mos of consecutive cough x 2 consecutive yrs)
- Distinct from PNA (parenchymal consolidation, fever >100.4F, hypoxia, tachypnea)
- DDx: COVID-19, post-nasal drip, GERD, undertreated/new asthma, ACE-i induced bradykinin cough, undertreated CHF, acute PE, or new lung cancer
- Clinical dx; CXR/labs not necessary unless PNA suspected

## Management

- Supportive: lozenges, cough suppressants (guaifenesin or dextromethorphan), smoking cessation. Consider albuterol inhaler for wheezing
- No indication for antibiotics

# Influenza

## Background

- Dx often clinical w/cough, sore throat, #sputum/nasal discharge, HA, fever, myalgias, and malaise; ± N/V/D. Exam with increased flushing, rarely with lower respiratory symptoms

## Evaluation

- During flu season: Obtain COVID/RPP or dedicated influenza PCR; testing is more accurate if obtained within 96 hour of symptom onset

- CXR if concerned for bacterial superinfection

## Management

- Antivirals most effective when given <48 hours from symptom onset; however, recommended to be given if symptomatic despite duration and to all hospitalized patients

- Oseltamivir 75mg BID x 5 days, peramivir 600mg IV x 1 (needs renal adjustment), or baloxavir (age ≥12) 40mg once (use 80 mg if >80kg)

- Amantadine and rimantadine are no longer used due to emerging resistance
