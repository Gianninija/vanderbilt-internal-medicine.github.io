# Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS)

## Background:
-	An inflammatory syndrome divided into paradoxical and unmasking IRIS.
    -	Unmasking IRIS refers to the flare-up of an underlying, preexisting infection in patients with HIV after antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation
    -	Paradoxical IRIS refers to the worsening of a previously treated Infection after Initiation of ART.
-	Typically develops between 1 week to a couple months after starting ART
-	Patients with lower CD4 counts and higher viral loads who respond well to ART are at higher risk of IRIS

## Evaluation:
-	IRIS is a clinical diagnosis
    -	Presentation consistent with either a systemic or localized inflammatory response (specific clinical features dependent on underlying infection)
    -	Most often seen in patients with significantly decreased CD4 counts who have a profound virologic and immunologic response to ART
    -	Infections most associated with IRIS include meningeal presentations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Cryptococcus neoformans.
    -	Other Infections include CMV, PJP, HSV, HBV, HHV-8, and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)
    -	Need to rule out drug-resistant infection or nonadherence to antimicrobials, bacterial superinfection, or medication adverse effect

## Management:
-	Prior to ART initiation, must evaluate for all opportunistic infections (OI), especially when an inflammatory response could cause swelling in an enclosed space (cryptococcal meningitis/encephalitis, tuberculous meningitis, CMV retinitis)
    -	If these serious CNS infections are identified, initiation of ART is often delayed until OI is well-controlled with antimicrobials
-	IRIS is usually a self-limited syndrome as long as infection is adequately treated
    -	Patients with IRIS should continue both ART and antimicrobial treatment for underlying OI
    -	In severe cases, glucocorticoids can be used to decrease inflammation
