# Fever in a Return Traveler

Madelaine Behrens

---

## Background
-	Treatment of fever in a return traveler will depend on where the traveler came from and what risk their fever poses to themselves or others. 

## Presentation
-	Is the pt sick? AMS, tachypneic, hypotensive 
-	Do they have signs of severe disease? Cyanosis, meningism (nuchal rigidity, photophobia, headache), peritonitis, digital gangrene
-	History Pearls
    -	Obtain travel history: location(s), activities, purpose of travel, accommodations
    -	Did they visit a friend or relative? (less likely to seek pretravel medical advice, higher risk for malaria, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, hepatitis A, and STD)
    -	Were they hospitalized abroad? (consider MDR organisms)
-	Physical Exam Pearls
    -	Skin rash with or without conjunctivitis (i.e., measles, meningococcemia, hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola)
    -	Rapid respiratory rate (i.e., influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome [MERS], pneumonic plague)
    -	Persistent cough (i.e., TB, pertussis)
    -	Decreased consciousness (i.e., meningococcal meningitis, rabies)
    -	Bruising or unusual bleeding without previous injury (i.e., hemorrhagic fevers)
    -	Persistent voluminous diarrhea (i.e., cholera)
    -	Persistent vomiting other than air or motion sickness (i.e., norovirus)
    -	Jaundice (i.e., hepatitis A)
    -	Flaccid paralysis of recent onset (polio)

## Evaluation
-	Are you suspicious for a possible high-risk infection? Isolate, report to health department as appropriate 
-	Most common serious cause of fever is malaria falciparum: order thick and thin blood smears. If negative, repeat the test. 
-	Viral hemorrhagic fevers such as Ebola, Crimean–Congo hemorrhagic fever, Marburg hemorrhagic fever, and Lassa fever are highly transmissible and require immediate treatment
-	Incubation periods:
    -	<21 days: East African trypanosomiasis, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, malaria, meningococcemia, nontyphoidal salmonellosis, plague, typhoid fever, typhus, viral hemorrhagic fevers, yellow fever
    -	&gt;21 days: acute HIV, acute systemic schistosomiasis, amebic liver abscess, borreliosis (relapsing fever), brucellosis, leishmaniasis, malaria (esp after ineffective prophylaxis), rabies, TB, viral hepatitides, West African trypanosomiasis,
-	 Fever pattern and course (not always helpful), notable exceptions include
        - Relapsing fevers (fever spikes separated by days or weeks): borreliosis, malaria
        - 48 hour interval fevers: plasmodium vivax or P ovale
        - 72 hour fevers: Plasmodium malariae
        - intermittent, unsynchronized: P falciparum
-	Initial labs: CBC, CMP, blood cx, rapid tests for malaria and dengue, PCR testing of plasma sample (for tick borne), CXR, blood smear (thick and thin), UA with microscopy and culture. Consider O &P, head imaging or LP, or additional abdominal imaging in the right clinical context.
-	Don’t forget the common causes of fever (could have nothing to do with pt’s travel)
-	Look up current outbreaks to help guide clinical suspicion. https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news
