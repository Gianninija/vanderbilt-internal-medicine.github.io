General Tips

- Vanderbilt Antibiotics Stewardship Program (VASP) has a
    [website](https://www.vumc.org/antimicrobial-stewardship-program/)
    with much of the below guidance as well as Vanderbilt antibiograms, with
    our resistance patterns

- Does your pt need to be on precautions?
    Check the [Infection Prevention Website](https://www.vumc.org/infectioncontrol/12177)
    under ‘isolation’ tab or page the infection control pager in E-star
    paging for additional questions

- Page 317-4376 for approval of restricted antimicrobials at VUMC
    (page the VA ID fellow at the VA)

- The lab will automatically update the Tennessee health department
    with reportable diseases

Skin and Soft Tissue Infection (SSTI) – VASP

Cellulitis

Background

- DDx: erysipelas, pyomyositis, necrotizing fasciitis, osteomyelitis,
    venous stasis, shingles, gout

- Pathogens: Streptococcus species: Group A (most common), B, C, G,
    Staphylococcus aureus (including MSSA and MRSA)

<!-- -->

- Non-purulent, lymphangitis, or erysipelas? Think *Streptococcus*

- Purulence (abscess or boil)? Think *Staphylococcus*

<!-- -->

- Unique clinical scenarios and associated organisms/organisms to
    consider:

<!-- -->

- Dog/cat bite: *Pasteurella multicoda, Capnocytophaga canimorsus*

- Human bite: *Eikenella corrodens*, oral anaerobes, *S. aureus*

- Fresh water exposure: *Aeromonas hydropholia, Plesiomonas
    shigelloides*

- Saltwater exposure: *Vibrio vulnificus*

- Neutropenia, presence of ecthyma: Gram negatives (*Pseudomonas
    aeruginosa*)

- Immunocompromised: Fungal (*Candida* spp, *Cryptococcus*),
    *Nocardia*, non-tubercular mycobacteria)

- Burn patients: *Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Fusarium*

Evaluation

- Outline border of erythema and obtain urgent surgery consultation if
    rapid spread of infection, crepitus, air in tissues or pain
    dramatically out of proportion to exam

- Blood cultures (BCx): ONLY needed if systemic signs/symptoms of
    infection or immunocompromised (most pts will not need BCx or
    imaging)

- Ultrasound for underlying abscess

- CT/MRI w/contrast: if necrotizing fasciitis, pyomyositis or
    osteomyelitis suspected

- Bilateral lower extremity cellulitis is RARE and warrants further
    consideration of other non-infectious etiologies

- Elevation test: if erythema improves after elevating leg above the
    level of the heart for 1-2 minutes, less likely to be infectious
    cellulitis

Management

- Antibiotics for 5 days for uncomplicated; can extend to 10-14 days
    if little to no improvement, more extensive/serious infection, or if
    immunosuppressed

- Typically improvement is not seen until \>48 hours of antibiotics,
    usually longer

- Provide anti-*Staphylococcal* antibiotics for purulent cellulitis in
    addition to I&D, if abscess present

- Clinical appearance may often appear to worsen initially despite
    adequate therapy

- Always elevate the extremity for more rapid clinical improvement!

Necrotizing Fasciitis

Background

- Infection of the deeper soft tissues that causes necrosis along the
    muscle fascia and overlying subcutaneous fat that is rapidly
    progressive and lethal if not addressed

- Clinical cues include rapid spread, pain out of proportion to exam,
    crepitus and hemorrhagic bullae

Evaluation/Management

- SURGICAL EMERGENCY!

<!-- -->

- STAT consult to surgical service for emergent debridement (generally
    EGS vs ortho)

- Imaging does NOT rule out necrotizing fasciitis and should not delay
    these consultations

<!-- -->

- ID consult

<!-- -->

- Blood cultures, but this should not delay antibiotic administration

- Contact and droplet precautions x first 24h of abx therapy; after
    this, contact precautions only if draining or contained wounds

- Vancomycin + either piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375g IV q8h extended
    infusion OR cefepime 2gm IV q8h + clindamycin 600mg-900mg IV q8h
    (for antitoxin effects)

Genitourinary Infection – VASP

Asymptomatic Bacteriuria

Background

- Isolation of bacteria in an appropriately collected urine specimen
    from an individual without symptoms or signs of urinary tract
    infection. Bacteriuria, foul odor, urine appearance, pyuria, falls
    and/or confusion alone are not indicative of infection.

- Oliguric ESRD patients may have bacteriuria from colonization due to
    lack of flushing of bladder; avoid sending UA/UCx unless patient is
    symptomatic

- Treatment only required for specific populations:

<!-- -->

- Pregnant women (screening performed at 12 – 16 weeks)

- Anticipated urologic intervention - when requesting, be sure to ask
    for Micro help in identifying potential pathogens needing treatment
    vs. likely contaminants

- Some renal transplant recipients, depending on time since transplant

Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)

Background

- Clinical symptoms of UTI (dysuria/urgency/frequency/ hematuria) in
    non-pregnant, immunocompetent, neurologically intact pt with normal
    urologic anatomy and no indwelling urinary catheters

Management

- Empiric therapy

<!-- -->

- Nitrofurantoin monohydrate: 100 mg PO BID x 5 days (avoid if any
    concern for pyelonephritis or if creatinine clearance \<60)

- Cephalexin 250-500mg q6h x5-7 days

<!-- -->

- Alternative therapies

<!-- -->

- Fosfomycin: 3 grams of powder mixed in water as a single PO dose
    (avoid if any concern for ascending UTI or pyelonephritis).
    Susceptibility test results must be requested of micro lab and are
    only possible for E. coli and E. Faecalis.

- Amoxicillin-clavulanate: 875-125mg PO BID x5 days

- Ciprofloxacin: 250mg PO BID x3 days

    - FQ’s should be reserved for more serious infections than
        uncomplicated cystitis, and only after susceptibility results
        are confirmed given high rates of resistance

    - Adverse effect profile \>\> beta-lactams (i.e. QT-prolongation,
        tendinopathies)

<!-- -->

- Avoid amoxicillin, ampicillin, and Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
    (TMP-SMX) due to increasing resistance unless culture data with
    confirmed susceptibility

Additional Information

- MDR cystitis: ESBL isolates are increasingly common due to
    antibiotic overuse

<!-- -->

- Before treating, decide if this is a TRUE UTI

- If true, consider Fosfomycin (if *E. coli*) or nitrofurantoin (if
    susceptibility is confirmed – *K. pneumoniae* and *Enterobacter* spp
    are usually resistant), gentamicin or tobramycin 5-7mg/kg IV once,
    or ID consultation

- Ask the lab to check susceptibility results to these antibiotics for
    future reference

Complicated UTI and Pyelonephritis

Background

- Fever, pyuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness suggest
    pyelonephritis.

- Consider it a complicated UTI if any of the following are present:

<!-- -->

- Renal calculi or other obstructive disease, immunosuppressed host,
    abnormal urological anatomy or physiology (including stents),
    presence of a urinary catheter

- Male sex alone does NOT qualify as complicated

Evaluation

- UA with reflex urine culture

- BCx and UCx prior to antibiotics

- If there is no pyuria, consider an alternative diagnosis, or
    proximal ureteral obstruction

<!-- -->

- Pyuria is common in the presence of a urinary catheter, kidney
    stones, urostomy, ileal conduit and other invasive devices, and may
    not indicate infection

Management

- Antibiotic Duration: 7-14 days, depending on antibiotic choice

- Tailor therapy once/if cultures are available. If no improvement in
    48h, consider imaging to rule out complications (e.g., perinephric
    abscess)

\*FQ’s have same bioavailability if given PO or IV so oral is preferred

Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI)

Background

- Culture growth of \> 10<sup>3</sup> cfu/mL of uropathogenic
    bacteria + signs or symptoms consistent with infection (without
    another identified etiology) + indwelling urethral/suprapubic
    catheter or intermittent catheterization.

<!-- -->

- This includes pts with catheters in place during the preceding 48
    hours

<!-- -->

- Duration = greatest risk factor (Increases 3-10% per day of
    catheterization)

<!-- -->

- Other risks: female sex, diabetes, elderly, colonization of catheter
    bag, poor care

<!-- -->

- Bacteriuria, foul odor, pyuria, urine appearance falls and/or
    confusion alone are not indicative of infection in patients who are
    otherwise asymptomatic.

- Ensure clean sample collected

<!-- -->

- Ideally, catheter is removed and midstream sample obtained

- If catheterization required; removal of old catheter and sample
    taken from new catheter

Management

- Distinguish uncomplicated vs complicated UTI (see above)

- Antimicrobial management:

<!-- -->

- Guided by cultures and susceptibilities

- Empiric guidance as per management of uncomplicated/complicated UTI
    and per prior culture data/susceptibilities when available.

- Duration: 7 – 14 days depending on antibiotic, clinical response and
    whether infection constitutes complicated vs uncomplicated UTI

- Special note regarding *Candida* UTI management: *Candida* is
    generally not pathogenic

    - Presence in urine does not indicate infection (unless
        perinephric abscess, renal transplant, or complex fistulous
        disease)

    - Fluconazole achieves excellent urinary penetration

    - If fluconazole-resistant *Candida* is cultured or suspected,
        consult ID

    - Susceptibilities are not routinely run-on *Candida* from urine
        cultures and would need to be requested if concern for true
        infection.

<!-- -->

- Catheter management

<!-- -->

- At the least, catheters should be replaced at the time of antibiotic
    initiation (preferably removed)

- If catheterization is necessary, intermittent catheterization is
    preferred over continuous use with patient educations on
    cleaning/hygiene prior to catheterization. Condom catheters and pure
    wicks also preferred over foley catheter

Sexually Transmitted Infections – Ashley Zeoli

Gonorrhea

Background

- Cause: gram-negative coccus *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*

- Gonorrhea causes a spectrum of disease including urethritis,
    cervicitis, epididymitis, proctitis, pharyngeal infections,
    conjunctivitis, PID, and disseminated gonococcal infection

Evaluation

- Microbial diagnosis is required to diagnose gonorrhea, rather than
    clinical diagnosis alone

- Test of choice: NAAT of the first-catch urine in men; NAAT of
    vaginal swab in women

<!-- -->

- Also perform co-testing for chlamydia

<!-- -->

- NAAT of pharyngeal or rectal swab should also be performed in
    patients with reported symptoms and recent sexual exposure. Note
    this is also routine testing in patients on PREP.

- Routine screening should be offered to sexually active patients, as
    many are asymptomatic

Management

- Ceftriaxone is the only current antibiotic that meets the strict
    treatment efficacy goals with single-dose therapy. CTX also has a
    low rate of drug resistance, which is becoming an increasing issue
    in the treatment of gonorrhea.

<!-- -->

- **High dose IM ceftriaxone** (\<150kg 500mg IM; \>150mg 1g IM)

    - Same for pharyngitis or conjunctivitis

- CTX allergies: Azithromycin (2g PO x1) + Gentamicin (240mg IM x1) or
    Gemifloxacin

<!-- -->

- Treatment of chlamydia must also be accompanied with gonorrhea
    treatment when it has not been excluded with molecular testing.

<!-- -->

- Doxycycline 100mg BID for 7 days

<!-- -->

- Patients who have persistent symptoms despite treatment should be
    suspected of having resistant gonorrhea. Test with culture and
    antimicrobial susceptibility testing (with or without NAAT).

- Patients with recurrent symptoms after period of resolution should
    be re-evaluated for gonorrhea and other STIs

Chlamydia

Background

- Cause: gram negative bacteria *Chlamydia trachomatis*

- Most individuals are asymptomatic though causes a wide array of
    infections: urethritis, cervicitis PID, conjunctivitis,
    perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome), pneumonia, proctitis,
    epididymitis, reactive arthritis, pharyngitis, lymphogranuloma
    venereum (LGV), endemic trachoma

- Differential diagnosis: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas
    vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium

Evaluation

- Test of choice: NAAT of vaginal swab in females (first catch urine
    also adequate); NAAT of first catch urine in males.

- NAATs can detect both LGV and non-LGV chlamydia trachomatis, but
    cannot distinguish between them

- Any patient with signs and symptoms concerning for chlamydia should
    be tested. Testing should also routinely be offered to sexually
    active individuals since most patients are asymptomatic. Note this
    is also routine testing in patients on PREP.

Management

- **Doxycycline** **100mg BID x 7 days** is the preferred treatment in
    non-pregnant patients (azithromycin is NOT preferred)

<!-- -->

- Alternative treatment options (for allergies/severe
    contraindications): azithromycin (1g PO x 1), levofloxacin (500mg PO
    daily x7 days), and ofloxacin (300mg BID PO x7 days)

<!-- -->

- Patients with recent potential or confirmed exposure within the last
    1-2 weeks should be treated empirically

- Patients with persistent symptoms, confirmed infection, and who
    already underwent appropriate treatment, likely have a re-infection,
    rather than treatment failure. Test again.

- Patients with recurrent symptoms after resolution should be
    re-tested for chlamydia with a NAAT and other STIs (gonorrhea, BV,
    etc).

- Empiric therapy for gonorrhea should be given to patients unless
    NAAT is negative

Syphilis

Background

- Caused by the spirochete, *Treponema pallidum,* which is visualized
    by dark field microscopy

- High rate of HIV co-infection among MSM with syphilis (\~42%)

- Transmitted by direct contact with an infectious lesion during sex.
    Infection can occur anywhere inoculation occurs (i.e. contact with
    infected secretions can result in a lesion on any tissue site)

- Can readily cross the placenta fetal infection

- Patients can present with a variety of symptoms, depending on their
    place in the disease course

Evaluation

- Test all patients with signs and symptoms, as well as patients who
    are at increased risk for acquiring infection (patients with sexual
    partner with early syphilis, MSM, people living with HIV, high risk
    sexual behaviors, and history of commercial sex work or
    incarceration)

- HIV testing should be offered to all patients who test positive

- Pregnant patients should be screened for syphilis

- There are two types of serologic tests: treponemal-specific tests
    (FTA-ABS, MHA-TP, TPPA, TP-EIA, CIA) and nontreponemal tests (RPR,
    VDRL, TRUST). Either can be used as initial screening, but
    confirmatory testing with the other is needed due to false
    positives.

<!-- -->

- Treponemal specific are usually used as confirmatory tests when
    nontreponemal tests are reactive. They are reported as reactive or
    non-reactive. Once positive, usually positive for life.

- Nontreponemal quantifies amount of antibody present and can be used
    to detect titers to assess for treatment. Titers should decline
    after a patient has been treated. A rise in titers in a previously
    treated patient should be concerning for new infection.

    - Requires a humoral response, so can be false negatives if
        immunocompromised

    - False positives: autoimmune diseases, pregnancy, other
        infections

<!-- -->

- At VUMC, a positive treponemal IgG reflexes to a RPR titer.

- Neurosyphilis can occur at any time after infection. All newly
    diagnosed patients with syphilis should have a full neurologic exam
    and if any abnormalities should have an LP sent for CSF-VDRL.

- Any patients with syphilis and vision changes should get an
    ophthalmology evaluation.

Pulmonary Infections – VASP, Evan Schwartz

Acute Bronchitis

Background

- 1-3 wks productive cough, often preceded by URI, may have
    wheezing/rhonchi

- Distinct from chronic bronchitis (\>3 mos of consecutive cough x 2
    consecutive yrs)

- Distinct from PNA (parenchymal consolidation, fever \>100.4F,
    hypoxia, tachypnea)

- DDx: COVID-19, post-nasal drip, GERD, undertreated/new asthma, ACE-i
    induced bradykinin cough, undertreated CHF, acute PE, or new lung
    cancer

- Typically a clinical dx; CXR/labs not necessary unless PNA suspected

Management

- Supportive: lozenges, cough suppressants (guaifenesin or
    dextromethorphan), smoking cessation. Consider albuterol inhaler for
    wheezing

- No indication for antibiotics

Influenza

Background

- Dx often clinical w/cough, sore throat, \#sputum/nasal discharge,
    HA, fever, myalgias, and malaise; ± N/V/D. Exam with increased
    flushing, rarely with lower respiratory symptoms

Evaluation

- During flu season: Obtain COVID/RPP or dedicated influenza PCR;
    testing is more accurate if obtained within 96 hour of symptom onset

- CXR if concerned for bacterial superinfection

Management

- Antivirals most effective when given \<48 hours from symptom onset;
    however, recommended to be given if symptomatic despite duration and
    to all hospitalized patients

- Oseltamivir 75mg BID x 5 days, peramivir 600mg IV x 1 (needs renal
    adjustment), or baloxavir (age ≥12) 40mg once (use 80 mg if \>80kg)

- Amantadine and rimantadine are no longer used due to emerging
    resistance

Inpatient COVID-19 Management – Kathryn Snyder

Background

- COVID-19 is the novel coronavirus responsible for the ongoing
    pandemic that started in late 2019. The virus has ongoing mutations
    resulting in new dominant strains.

Evaluation

- Please see the most updated VUMC and VA guidance due to frequently
    evolving recommendations.

- Please refer to the hospital’s current maximum oxygen requirement
    allowed on the floor to ensure patient is appropriately triaged.

- Basic admission workup for symptomatic, confirmed COVID-19

<!-- -->

- Labs: CBC with diff, CMP, d-dimer, ferritin, CRP, ESR, PT/INR, PTT,
    procalcitonin, RPP

- Imaging: portable CXR

- Nursing: Strict I/O

- Enhanced precautions (contact, airborne, eye protection)

Management

- Fluid balance goal slightly net negative to even

- Anticoagulation/DVT prophylaxis:

<!-- -->

- Please see latest VUMC or VA guidance based on clinical status
    (supplemental O2 requirements, ICU vs floor, etc.)

<!-- -->

- Pharmacologic therapies

<!-- -->

- Note: Therapies, indications, and contraindications are frequently
    changing, please see latest VUMC/VA guidelines for specific
    indications for these medications or others

- Remdesivir

    - Loading dose 200mg IV x1 then 100mg daily x 4 days

    - For use in patients hospitalized for COVID within 7 days of
        symptom onset

    - Contraindications: known hypersensitivity, ALT \>/= 10x ULN,
        high-flow NC, PPV, intubated, or on ECMO

    - Monitoring: baseline CBC, INR, q48h CMP

- Dexamethasone

    - 6mg PO/IV x 10 days; consideration of longer taper if no
        clinical improvement or persistently elevated CRP

    - Contraindications: no hard contraindications, use clinical
        judgement if concomitant serious bacterial/fungal infection

- Antibiotics:

    - The incidence of superimposed bacterial infection in the setting
        of COVID-19 is low

    - The majority of patients do not need additional coverage for
        bacterial pneumonia

    - You can use procalcitonin to guide decision

- Other pharmacologic therapies include baricitinib (JAK inhibitor),
    tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) and monoclonal antibodies

Additional Information

- Complications and special considerations for COVID-19 patients

<!-- -->

- High PE/DVT risk

- Superimposed bacterial PNA

- AKI

- GI symptoms/abnormalities (see GI section on COVID-19)

Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)

Background

- All PNA that does not otherwise meet criteria for Hospital Acquired
    Pneumonia (PNA that develops ≥48 hours after hospital admission),
    Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (PNA that develops ≥48-72 hours
    after endotracheal intubation), or aspiration PNA

- Healthcare-associated pneumonia is no longer a clinical entity per
    2016 IDSA guidelines

- MRSA Risk Factors: recent history, cavitary lesion, post-influenza
    bacterial PNA, pts with IDU, severe hypoxemia requiring intubation

- *Pseudomonas*: Double coverage is not indicated in general
    population; LVQ has 82% sensitivity so not recommended unless
    isolate proven susceptible

Evaluation

- Sputum cultures prior to abx, consider BCx in select groups (severe
    pneumonia, ICU admission, cavitary disease, immunosuppression).

- Rule out flu if the right season, COVID-19, consider RVP if it will
    change management

- CURB-65 or PSI can aid in decision between outpatient vs inpatient
    therapy

<!-- -->

- CURB65: Confusion, Uremia (BUN \>=19 mg/dL), RR (\>30/min),
    BP(\<90/60 mmHg), Age ≥ 65 If ≥ 2, hospitalization is recommended.

<!-- -->

- Consider urine pneumococcal Ag, urine Legionella Ag in severe CAP
    and in certain pts (e.g., neutropenia, asplenia, obstructive lung
    disease, hyponatremia, diarrhea, or heavy alcohol use); these are
    performed at reference labs and will take several days to return.

- CRP, ESR, and pro-calcitonin have not been shown to reliably improve
    outcomes; however, pro-calcitonin \< 0.25 suggests against bacterial
    respiratory infection and antibiotic discontinuation is encouraged

- PA/ lateral CXR to evaluate for and localize infiltrate. If
    immunocompromised, consider CT chest w/o contrast (does not improve
    outcomes)

<!-- -->

- Lobar Consolidation - likely bacterial

- Interstitial Infiltrate - likely atypical vs. viral vs.
    non-infectious

- Cavitation - concerning for fungal vs. necrotizing vs. mycobacterial

Management

- Antibiotic Duration: 5-7 days (at least 5 days and improvement with
    clinical stability)

\*No chronic heart, lung, liver, renal disease, DM, alcoholism,
immunocompromise

Additional Information

- MRSA nasal swab has reported negative predictive value for MRSA
    pneumonia ranging 95% to \>99%; consider sending and if negative,
    discontinue MRSA agent

- CTX is generally adequate coverage for aspiration PNA without
    evidence of abscess, empyema, or cavitary lesion on imaging

- Aspiration pneumonia can be confused for aspiration pneumonitis
    which does not need to be treated with antibiotics. Rapid resolution
    of leukocytosis and stabilization of vitals suggest aspiration
    pneumonitis and consideration of stopping antibiotics.

- There is low sensitivity of S. pneumoniae to azithromycin (42%) and
    doxycycline (72%), so these should not be used as monotherapy

- Check for drug interactions with linezolid (e.g., SSRI, methadone,
    methamphetamine use)

Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) and Ventilator Associated Pneumonia
(VAP)

Background

- HAP: Pneumonia that develops \>48 hours after admission

- VAP: Pneumonia that develops \>48 hours after endotracheal
    intubation

Evaluation

- Cultures of blood, sputum, endotracheal aspirate and/or bronchoscopy
    specimen

- Consider MRSA nares to help with de-escalation

- If there is concern for respiratory viruses: send influenza, COVID,
    RVP

Management

- Initially cover for MRSA and *Pseudomonas*

- Antibiotic Duration: 7 days in uncomplicated cases, although
    specific pathogens (e.g., *Pseudomonas*) may require longer duration
    and ID guidance

- Consider ID consultation if the patient is not clinically improving
    on empiric therapy or if an MDR pathogen grows from culture

- If no MRSA isolated and pt is improving, consider stopping
    vancomycin ASAP

- There is concern for nephrotoxicity with combination Vancomycin and
    piperacillin-tazobactam, but data controversial

Diabetic Foot Infection – VASP

Evaluation

- Plain radiograph for all pts; MRI w/contrast if abscess/osteo
    suspected

- BCx (prior to antibiotics) if systemic signs of infection, or severe
    infection

<!-- -->

- Do not culture swabs of lesions, as these generally only grow
    colonizing organisms.

<!-- -->

- Consult podiatry if osteomyelitis present for bone specimen culture
    and pathology (either from debridement specimen or bone biopsy)
    prior to starting antibiotics.

- Consult surgery if concern for abscess, gas in tissue, joint
    involvement

- Assess peripheral vasculature, consider arterial flow
    studies/vascular surgery consult

Management

- Assess Severity:

<!-- -->

- Mild: Local infxn, skin/subQ tissue only, erythema \>0.5 cm but ≤2cm
    from ulcer

- Moderate: Local infxn w/erythema \> 2 cm from ulcer or deeper
    structures included without SIRS

- Severe: Local infxn with systemic inflammation as evidenced by \>2
    SIRS criteria

    - Consider anti-pseudomonal coverage if at risk for *Pseudomonas*
        infection (e.g. wet; failure of prior antibiotic therapy;
        chronic wound).

    - Consider anaerobic coverage with metronidazole if foul-smelling
        and/or necrotic.

Additional Information

- If pt HDS, hold abx until deep tissue/operative cultures obtained.

- Most diabetic foot infections are polymicrobial in nature.

- Culture results may guide therapy, but all pathogens identified may
    not require treatment.

Joint Infections and Osteomyelitis – VASP

Evaluation

- Blood cultures prior to antibiotics

- MRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for
    osteomyelitis.

- Ortho consult for joint fluid aspirate or bone bx; send for culture
    and send fluid for cell count/differential.

Management

- Hold antibiotics until culture obtained, if patient is clinically
    stable

- Osteomyelitis is a 6-week treatment course, can consider early
    transition (at 2-3 weeks) to oral if good bioavailability and
    susceptibility.

- For prosthetic joint infection, procedure/retention of hardware
    determines duration

- First line empiric: Vancomycin + ciprofloxacin 750mg BID

- Antimicrobial therapy will ultimately be guided by culture data, ID
    consult recommended for joint infection treatment due to need for
    prolonged antibiotic therapy

Bacteremia: Interpreting GenMark ePlex® Results – VASP

Background

- When BCx turn positive, the lab reports Gram stain and GenMark
    ePlex® results to help guide empiric therapy, while awaiting further
    species identification and susceptibilities.

Management

- Start empiric antibiotic therapy (based on clinical picture and
    table below)

- Consider ordering repeat BCx x2 based on organism to document
    clearance

<!-- -->

- Repeat for: *Staph* (MRSA or MSSA), *Strep lugdunensis*

- If source control & no endovascular infxn, no need to repeat (most
    other strep and GNR’s)

<!-- -->

- [VUMC
    antibiograms](https://www.vumc.org/antimicrobial-stewardship-program/antibiograms)
    can be used to reference typical resistance patterns and most common
    organisms in blood cultures.

- *Candida* in a blood culture is NEVER considered a contaminant

Endocarditis – Justin Smith

Background

- Multiple etiologies of endocarditis:

<!-- -->

- Typical Bacterial

    - *S. aureus, Enterococcus* spp (*E. faecalis* most commonly),
        viridans group *streptococci*, *Strep gallolyticus* (formerly
        *S. bovis*)

    - HACEK: *Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella*

- Other infectious

    - Culture negative: often recent antimicrobial exposure, slow
        growing organism
    - *Coxiella*, *Brucella*, *Bartonella*, *Chlamydia*, *Legionella*,
        *Mycoplasma*, *Tropheryma whipplei*, *Cutibacterium acnes* (formerly *P. acnes*)
    - Fungal: *Candida* and *aspergillus* most common

- Non-infectious: a.k.a., marantic endocarditis, Libbman-Sacks
    Endocarditis

    - Rare, most common in advanced malignancy, SLE, inflammatory
        conditions
    - Higher risk for embolization compared to IE
    - Risk factors: IV drug use, congenital heart disease, valve
        abnormalities, intracardiac devices, recent cardiac surgery

Presentation

- Fever (90%), murmur (85%), other: splenomegaly, splinter
    hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, Roth spots

- Persistent bacteremia despite appropriate treatment, new onset
    cardiac dysfunction, new onset valve abnormalities, stroke, other
    thromboembolic events, metastatic infections/abscesses, splenic
    abscess, septic pulmonary emboli

Duke Criteria:

- Pathologic Criteria

<!-- -->

- Microorganisms: culture or histology proven: vegetation, embolus, or
    intracardiac abscess

- Pathologic vegetations: vegetation of abscess with histology proven
    endocarditis

<!-- -->

- Clinical Criteria

<!-- -->

- Definite: 2 Major, 1 major and 3 minor, or 5 minor

- Possible: 1 major and 1 minor, or 3 minor

- Rejected: firm alternate diagnosis, resolution of evidence with \<4
    days of antibiotics, or absence of pathologic evidence with \<4days
    of antibiotics

| **Major Criteria**                                 | **Minor Criteria**                                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2x positive blood cultures from a typical organism | Predisposing heart condition/IDU                                                    |
| Evidence of endocardial involvement                | Fever                                                                               |
|                                                    | Vascular phenomena (glomerulonephritis)                                             |
|                                                    | Immunologic phenomena (Osler nodes, Roth spots, +rheumatoid factor, GN)             |
|                                                    | Micro (cultures that don’t fit the above, or serologic evidence of acute infection) |

Evaluation

- Physical exam: murmur, decreased peripheral perfusion, evidence of
    heart failure, petechiae, splinter hemorrhages, Janeway
    lesions/Osler nodes, organomegaly

- Blood cultures: at least three sets from different sites over a span
    of several hours

- Echo (TTE vs TEE)

<!-- -->

- It can be reasonable to start with TEE if pretest probability is
    high enough, if patient already has known valvular abnormalities, or
    TTE will be technically difficult

<!-- -->

- EKG: new heart block or prolonged PR raises concern for
    endocardial/perivalvular abscess. Endocarditis patients should be on
    telemetry, monitored closely by team.

- CXR: infiltrates suggestive of septic pulmonary emboli, pulmonary
    edema, cardiomegaly

- Imaging of distant affected site if concerned for septic emboli

- Other advanced imaging in select scenario: cardiac CTA, cardiac MRI,
    FDG-PET/CT

Management

- Empiric antibiotics:

<!-- -->

- If bacteria isolated from blood, reference bacteremia section for
    abx choice

- If awaiting cultures

    - Native valve: Vancomycin +/- GNR coverage (depending on clinical
        stability, risk factors, etc.)

    - Prosthetic valve: Vancomycin and cefepime, consider gentamicin

<!-- -->

- Antibiotic Duration: determined by ID, often 4-6 weeks

- Cardiac surgery consult: if valve dysfunction, perivalvular abscess,
    large (\>20mm) vegetations, heart block, ongoing embolization on
    abx, delayed Cx clearance (\>1 week on abx)

Additional Information:

- Complications:

<!-- -->

- Cardiac:

    - Heart failure: usually secondary to valve dysfunction. Most
        common when aortic valve involved, risk also depends on organism
        (worst is *Staph aureus*)

    - Perivalvular abscess: suspect when there are conduction
        abnormalities on EKG.

    - Pericarditis: can be suppurative or non-suppurative

    - Intracardiac Fistula

- Septic emboli and metastatic abscesses

- Mycotic aneurysm: usually occurs at vessel branch points

<!-- -->

- Follow Up

<!-- -->

- Repeat TTE at completion of treatment to establish new baseline

- Followed for valvular dysfunction with frequency determined by
    nature of the dysfunction

- Regular dental care; prior IE is an indication for SBE prophylaxis
    with dental work.

<!-- -->

- Episode of IE is an indication for PDA or VSD closure

Central Nervous System Infection – VASP

Bacterial Meningitis

Evaluation

- Blood cultures prior to antibiotics if possible

- Head CT pre-LP, only if: Immunocompromised, hx of CNS diseases
    (shunts, trauma, tumors), papilledema on exam or FND, AMS, or new
    onset seizure.

- If there is a delay in obtaining head CT or LP, DO NOT delay
    antibiotics.

- Lumbar puncture (See Procedures Section):

<!-- -->

- Obtain: Opening pressure, cell count + differential, glucose,
    protein, bacterial culture

- Send an extra tube or two of CSF to the lab, if possible, to be
    frozen in case extra testing is needed (Order ‘Miscellaneous test’
    and for test name put “Please freeze CSF in virology;” reference
    lab: VUMC, specimen type: CSF)

- Additional studies to consider in select pts: HSV 1, 2 PCR (NOT
    antibodies), VZV PCR, VDRL, Crypto Ag, fungal and/or AFB cultures,
    MTB PCR, West Nile Virus Ab, Enterovirus PCR, Histoplasma Ag, or
    Biofire Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel. These should not be performed
    routinely on all patients and consult ID where management questions
    exist.

- If Biofire Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel is performed, double check
    what is included to avoid sending duplicate individual tests (ie
    HSV, VZV, enterovirus, etc.) A negative cryptococcus on Biofire does
    not exclude disease (CSF Crypto Ag is more sensitive)

Management

- ANTIBIOTICS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE:

<!-- -->

- Ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h + Vancomycin, adjusted for renal function

- Piperacillin-tazobactam cannot be used due to poor CNS penetration

- IV ampicillin 2g q4h for optional coverage of Listeria for
    immunocompromised patients, pregnant women, or age \>50 (adjust
    based on renal function)

- IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg (based on adjusted body weight) q8h, if
    suspected HSV or VZV meningitis, make sure to run with adequate
    pre-hydration with NS

- Consider empiric PO/IV doxycycline 100mg BID if tick-borne illness
    is suspected

<!-- -->

- Steroids: Based on IDSA guidelines, steroids (dexamethasone 0.15
    mg/kg q6h) should be given about 10-20 minutes before the first dose
    of antibiotics, or at the same time, in patients with suspected
    bacterial meningitis. IF pneumococcus is isolated, continue IV
    steroids for 2-4 days; otherwise, can discontinue

- ID consultation: Duration should be guided by ID and varies based on
    organism recovered

Encephalitis

Background

- The presence or absence of normal brain function/cognition is the
    important distinguishing clinical feature between encephalitis and
    meningitis

Evaluation

- MRI more sensitive that CT, although imaging may or may not
    demonstrate abnormal radiographic findings in patients with
    encephalitis

- LP – similar studies as for meningitis (see above) + BioFire MEP for
    ALL pts

Management

- Acyclovir 10mg/kg IV q8hr, consideration of antibacterial therapy if
    unable to conclusively exclude a bacterial meningitis, consideration
    of doxycycline if tick-borne infection is on the differential, and
    further treatment as guided by ID

- ID consult is strongly encouraged for all patients with suspected
    encephalitis

Brain Abscess

Evaluation/Management

- Consult: Neurosurgery and ID

- Blood Cultures, HIV testing in any patient with a brain lesion

- Empiric antibiotics:

<!-- -->

- IV Vancomycin (target trough 15 - 20 mcg/mL) + ceftriaxone 2g IV
    q12h + metronidazole 500mg IV/PO q6h

- If concern for extension from otitis externa, use an antipseudomonal
    cephalosporin (cefepime 2g IV Q8h) instead of ceftriaxone

- Brain abscesses generally polymicrobial, thus broad-spectrum
    antibiotics indicated

<!-- -->

- Aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline),
    clindamycin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase combinations (e.g., Zosyn)
    and 1st-generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefazolin) should NOT be
    used as they do not cross BBB at high concentration.

- Antibiotic Duration: Based on surgical drainage and Infectious
    Diseases guidance

Epidural Abscess

Management

- If spinal lesion, consult ‘Spine surgery’ and it will be directed to
    Ortho-Spine or Neurosurgery, depending on who is on call.

- Antibiotics should be started as soon as the diagnosis of epidural
    abscess is suspected, immediately following the collection of two
    sets of blood cultures

<!-- -->

- Vancomycin 15-20mg/kg IV q8-12h (adjusted for renal function) +
    ceftriaxone 2g IV q24h (or q12hr if there is secondary meningitis)

- Use cefepime 2g IV q8h instead of ceftriaxone if concern for
    *Pseudomonas*

<!-- -->

- ID consult is strongly encouraged and they will guide duration

Fungal Infections – Justin Smith

Histoplasmosis

Background

- Endemic to Ohio and Mississippi river valley

- Pulmonary infiltrate with hilar or mediastinal LAD, pulmonary
    nodule/cavitary lesion, pulmonary syndrome with erythema nodosum

- DDx: TB, malignancy, sarcoidosis (if considering sarcoidosis, rule
    out histoplasmosis as sarcoidosis treatment can induce disseminated
    histoplasmosis)

Evaluation

- Antigen (requires attending approval): For acute pulmonary
    histoplasmosis, 65% urine sensitivity, 69% serum sensitivity, and
    83% sensitivity when co-tested. Thus, both serum and urine Ag are
    usually sent together

<!-- -->

- Lower rates of positivity when disease is localized, versus diffuse
    throughout the lungs or disseminated.

- There are relatively high rates of cross-reactivity, where
    histoplasma antigen will be positive with blastomycosis; therefore,
    do not order blasto Ag if ordering histo Ag in MOST cases

<!-- -->

- Serology: Consider Histoplasma Ab if evaluating for pulmonary
    disease

- Culture: most useful in chronic infections, sensitivity is low in
    acute/localized and may take \>6 weeks to grow.

- Bronchoscopy: If clinical suspicion is high and work up negative,
    consider interventional pulmonology consult for consideration of
    bronchoscopy

Management

- Outpatient/Mild disease:

<!-- -->

- Tx not required if symptoms \<4 weeks, initiate if symptomatic
    beyond 4 weeks

- Itraconazole: 200mg TID x3 days loading, then BID (adjusted by
    levels which are drawn 2 weeks post-start) for 6-12 weeks minimum

- Can use oral formulation or capsules (capsules require high acidity,
    give with food consumption or OJ or coke; do not use capsules if
    patient is on H2 blockers/PPI)

- Voriconazole, Posaconazole: used if not tolerating itraconazole or
    as salvage therapy

<!-- -->

- Inpatient/Moderate to Severe Disease:

<!-- -->

- Amphotericin: 1-2 weeks induction, followed by PO itraconazole for
    12 weeks (total)

- Methylprednisolone: help to prevent ARDS with significant lung
    involvement

Additional Information

- Complications: Pericarditis, arthritis/arthralgias with erythema
    nodosum, chronic cavitary lesions, fibrosing mediastinitis,
    broncholithiasis

- Disseminated Histoplasmosis:

<!-- -->

- Typically found in immunocompromised populations

- Clinical presentations: FUO, weight loss, disseminated LAD,
    cutaneous manifestations, bone marrow suppression/pancytopenia,
    liver enzymes elevation, various solid organ involvement on imaging
    (liver, spleen, adrenals, nodes)

- Management

    - Mild: itraconazole

    - Moderate to Severe: amphotericin induction followed by
        itraconazole

    - CNS involvement: amphotericin for 4-6 weeks as induction

Blastomycosis

Background

- Endemic to Mississippi/Ohio river valley, southern and midwestern
    US, great lakes

- Pulmonary syndrome: cough, fever, hemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnea

<!-- -->

- Can result in both an acute or chronic pneumonia, as well as ARDS

<!-- -->

- Cutaneous: raised verrucous lesion, varying in color, with irregular
    borders

- MSK: osteolytic lesion, draining sinus, soft tissue swelling

- Multi-system: up to 20-40% of cases, most typically lung/skin
    involvement.

Evaluation

- Culture: typically takes 1-4 weeks

- Ag: urine \>serum. \~90% sensitive, but only 80% specific because of
    cross-reactivity

- Serology: available, but not very useful because of high degree of
    cross-reactivity

Management

- Mild: PO itraconazole for 6-12 months with loading, check level at 2
    weeks

- Moderate to Severe: induction with Amphotericin, followed by 6-12
    months of PO itraconazole

Candida

Background

- Oropharyngeal: white plaques in mouth, change in taste, erythema
    without plaques

<!-- -->

- Usually seen in infants, older adults, immunocompromised host (HIV
    or chemotherapy), inhaled steroid users

<!-- -->

- Esophageal: odynophagia, especially retrosternal pain (AIDS defining
    illness)

- Vulvovaginitis: itching, burning, vaginal discharge, vulvar
    erythema, vulvar edema, dyspareunia, dysuria

- Balanitis: painful white plaques with burning and itching on the
    glans penis

- Mastitis: erythema, tenderness in breast feeding woman.

Management

- Depends on specifics, but typically nystatin or fluconazole EXCEPT
    *C. glabrata* (proof of fluconazole susceptibility needed) and *C.
    krusei* (intrinsically resistant to fluconazole)

- Cx generally not indicated unless complicated pt with extensive tx
    history for Candida

Additional Information

- Disseminated disease

<!-- -->

- Presentation: Primarily immunocompromised populations (hematologic
    malignancies, solid organ transplant recipients, receiving
    chemotherapy, TPN, steroid use, broad spectrum antibiotics) and ICU
    settings (especially, burn, trauma, and neonatal)

- Diagnosis: *Candida* in a bacterial blood culture (NEVER
    contaminant)

- Start micafungin 100mg IV and consult ID for candidemia or if
    concerned for disseminated disease

HIV/AIDS and ART – Kathryn Snyder and Quinton Taylor

Background

- Why is ART important?

<!-- -->

- Clear morbidity and mortality benefits across all CD4 counts

- Decreases subsequent infections (both common and opportunistic)

- Decreased HIV related comorbid conditions, viral reservoirs, and
    transmission

<!-- -->

- New HIV Diagnosis

<!-- -->

- ID consult if patient is not on Rogers ID service (important for
    initiation, follow up \[CCC\], social work assistance)

- ART is indicated for all HIV+ patients, regardless of CD4; however,
    starting ART requires appropriate outpatient follow up

- Lab evaluation:

    - HIV viral load, genotype, and resistance testing

    - T cell subsets (CD4 Count), CBC with differential, CMP, UA

    - HLA\*B5701 testing before using abacavir containing regimen

    - QuantiFERON Gold

    - Pregnancy testing

    - Viral hepatitis serologies

    - Toxoplasma serologies

    - Other STI screening (Syphilis, Gonorrhea/Chlamydia)

<!-- -->

- Timing of ART initiation

<!-- -->

- Factors affecting timing of initiation

    - Drug toxicity and interactions, risks for resistance, adherence
        barriers

    - Treatment of opportunistic infections may delay initiation of
        ART given associated risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory
        syndrome (IRIS)

        - Delay ART for several weeks after initiation of therapy for
            cryptococcal meningitis, tuberculosis, and CMV retinitis

<!-- -->

- ART plan for overnight admits: okay to continue home ART, special
    consideration for:

<!-- -->

- Patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction may need dose adjustment

- Interactions with other newly initiated medications

- If there is concern for non-adherence, can hold morning dose

- Combination pills may need to be ordered as separate components

<!-- -->

- Common key regimens for initiation

<!-- -->

- Most regimens consist of an NRTI backbone (2 agents) plus a
    3<sup>rd</sup> agent

- Some dual therapy regimens (such as Dovato@) are non-inferior to
    standard 3-drug therapy

- Many patients are started on combination pill regimens, including
    Integrase Inhibitor based regimens: Biktarvy®, Dovato®, Triumeq®,
    Genvoya®, dolutegravir + Descovy®

AIDS Defining Clinical Conditions – Rebecca Choudhury

AIDS is defined by HIV infection with concurrent absolute CD4 count
\<200, CD4 percentage \<14%, or one of the following conditions
(predominately opportunistic infections and HIV associated
malignancies):

Neurologic/Ophthalmologic

CNS toxoplasmosis

- Presentation: Variable, depending on disease burden/location, may
    include AMS, headache, seizure, ataxia, and focal neurologic
    deficits, +/- fever and flu-like symptoms

- Evaluation: MRI w/ring-enhancing lesions on brain imaging, serum
    Toxoplasma IgG/IgM and (ideally) CSF Toxoplasma PCR (though CSF
    Toxoplasma PCR has a low sensitivity). Response to empiric therapy
    (\~90% will have radiographic improvement after 14 days) can also be
    diagnostic. Brain biopsy may be indicated if diagnostic uncertainty.

- Management: Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin is the
    preferred regimen, discuss dosing with pharmacy. Alternative
    regimens: clindamycin, Bactrim, atovaquone

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)

- Presentation: chronic (weeks to months), progressive neurologic
    dysfunction, particularly incoordination and other motor
    dysfunction, aphasia, sometimes cognitive impairment and personality
    changes

- Evaluation: MRI brain w/patchy areas of demyelination in the
    subcortical white matter; location is variable, but parietal,
    occipital, and cerebellar involvement are common. JC virus PCR from
    CSF. Brain biopsy.

- Management: Initiation of ART (there is no specific JC
    virus-directed therapy), IRIS may occur in which case clinical
    worsening before improvement may be seen. Fatal if HIV goes
    untreated.

HIV-related encephalopathy

- Presentation: Similar to other progressive dementias, with short
    term memory loss followed by worsening global cognitive dysfunction,
    motor deficits, sometimes seizures in late stages

- Evaluation: MRI w/diffuse cerebral atrophy and/or demyelinating
    lesions similar to PML. CSF w/elevated protein +/- lymphocytic
    pleocytosis, with no alternative cause. Send HIV RNA from the CSF,
    usually + in HIV encephalopathy

Cryptococcal meningitis

- Presentation: Subacute to chronically worsening HA and fevers;
    meningismus and photophobia may be present but are often absent;
    rarely, focal neurologic deficits

- Evaluation: LP to check opening pressure and can send serum and CSF
    Cryptococcus Ag. Brain imaging may be non-diagnostic

- Treatment: Induction therapy with amphotericin and flucytosine x14
    days (at least), with repeat LP close to end of induction to confirm
    CSF inflammation is improving and fungal culture is negative.
    Consolidation therapy consists of high dose fluconazole for at least
    8 weeks, followed by maintenance therapy with fluconazole for one
    year. Pts may require serial LP or VP shunt to manage ICP.

<!-- -->

- Delay ART for several weeks after start of treatment to avoid risk
    of IRIS.

CMV retinitis (with vision loss)

- Presentation: Blurry vision, focal blind spots, visual field
    deficits, or scotomas and floaters. Typically begins unilateral,
    though often progresses to bilateral involvement.

- Evaluation: Always consult ophtho if you suspect it! May cause
    complete retinal detachment. Check serum CMV PCR (or vitreous if
    able)

- Management: PO valgancyclovir (+intravitreous ganciclovir or
    foscarnet in severe disease). If not on ART, must delay ART for at
    least 2 weeks after start of CMV retinitis treatment to prevent
    immune recovery uveitis

Pulmonary

*Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PJP)

- Presentation: fever, shortness of breath, cough (usually
    non-productive), sometimes night sweats and weight loss. Hypoxia out
    of proportion to exam.

- Evaluation: CT chest appearance usually bilateral and diffuse with
    GGOs and cystic lesions of varying size. Large cysts can rupture,
    causing pneumothorax.

<!-- -->

- Transbronchial biopsy, BAL, or induced sputum with cytology and GMS
    stain.

- Sputum Pneumocystis PCR can be done, but this is a send-out with
    long turn-around-time

- Consider serum LDH and 1,3-BD-glucan: should be elevated, but are
    nonspecific.

<!-- -->

- Management: Bactrim is the preferred treatment; PO is preferable as
    Bactrim is 100% bioavailable. Check ABG on ROOM AIR to consider of
    adding adjunctive steroids (If A-a gradient \>/=35mmHg and/or PaO2
    \<70mmHg). Alternative regimens may include primaquine + clindamycin
    or IV (NOT inhaled) pentamidine.

Pulmonary tuberculosis

- Presentation: With low CD4, can have upper lobe cavities but also
    atypical radiographic pattern, including a normal-appearing CXR.
    Have a high degree of suspicion in any patient with advanced HIV and
    respiratory complaints.

- Evaluation: TB skin tests and IGRAs have a high false negative rate
    in advanced HIV. At VUMC, any pt with HIV and respiratory complaints
    must be placed on airborne until TB ruleout- 3 sputum mycobacterial
    cultures collected at least 8 hours apart. If concentrated smear is
    negative x3, TB is unlikely (though have to follow up final culture
    to be sure).

- Management: RIPE therapy is the standard initial treatment, with
    adjustment if needed for drug resistance or contraindications

*Herpes simplex* tracheobronchitis and/or pneumonitis/pneumonia

- Evaluation: bronchoscopy with positive HSV PCR from BAL +/- lung
    biopsy. (Usually associated with HSV-1)

- Management: agent and duration not well defined for bronchopulmonary
    disease; depending on severity of presentation, likely IV acyclovir
    to start followed by transition to PO antiviral once evidence of
    clinical improvement, for a total of 10-14 days.

Gastrointestinal

Esophageal candidiasis

- Presentation: Dysphagia, odynophagia or both. Concurrent
    oropharyngeal candidiasis (“thrush’) is common but not universal.

- Evaluation: Typically presumptive. Treatment is the test; start
    fluconazole and consider EGD if symptoms do not improve after
    several days (in which case candidiasis may be severe, or it might
    not be the cause)

- Management: Fluconazole; nystatin is ineffective, especially in the
    severely immunocompromised

*Herpes simplex* esophagitis

- Evaluation: EGD shows diffuse ulcerations throughout the esophagus;
    in severe disease ulcers may coalesce into dark patches, “black
    esophagus.” Esophageal biopsy is definitive, but can infer based on
    EGD appearance and serum studies.

- Management: Similar to other mucocutaneous infections, consider IV
    acyclovir at first and transition to PO once clinically improved

CMV esophagitis/enteritis/colitis

- Presentation: GI bleeding (colitis) or dysphagia and odynophagia
    (esophagitis)

- Evaluation: serum CMV PCR, consult GI for consideration of
    EGD/colonoscopy

- Management: (val)ganciclovir, foscarnet if ganciclovir resistance or
    contraindication

Chronic (\>1 mo) intestinal isosporiasis

- Evaluation: Stool ova/parasite can capture Iospora belli (new name
    Cystoisospora belli), may need serial analysis due to intermittent
    shedding. Oocysts may also be seen on duodenal biopsy.

- Management: Bactrim; pyrimethamine + leucovorin if Bactrim is
    contraindicated

Chronic intestinal cryptosporidiosis

- Presentation: Diarrhea; may infect respiratory tract, causing
    nonproductive cough

- Evaluation: on GiPP or Cryptosporidium Ag

- Management: Early initiation or optimization of ART; Monotherapy
    with nitazoxanide is preferred; raising CD4 count \>100 is necessary
    to cure infection

Recurrent *Salmonella* septicemia

- Generally sensitive to fluoroquinolones, but if not clinically
    improving as expected you can request sensitivities from the
    microbiology lab.

Neoplastic

Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma

- DLBCL, Burkitt’s, immunoblastic (subset of DLBCL), primary effusion
    lymphoma, and 1º CNS

Kaposi’s sarcoma

- Presentation: Distinctive mucocutaneous lesions, usually raised,
    papular, violaceous or darkly colored, non-tender and non-pruritic.
    Can also involve the visceral organs (esp lungs and GI tract) and
    deep lymphatic system.

- Evaluation: clinical, tissue biopsy for staging, HHV-8 serum PCR.

- Management: Limited mucocutaneous disease may resolve with
    initiation/optimization of ART, but widespread or resistant disease
    may require additional local therapies (eg: radiation) or systemic
    chemo

- Bacillary angiomatosis (caused by Bartonella) may present similarly,
    but can be distinguished from KS on biopsy. It is neither a cancer
    nor an AIDS defining clinical condition, and is usually treated with
    doxycycline.

Cervical cancer

- Presentation, diagnosis, and treatment are essentially the same as
    in HIV-negative patients, but incidence is higher and disease
    progression is often more rapid

Multisystem/Miscellaneous

Extrapulmonary or disseminated Mycobacterial infection (TB and non-TB)

- TB can go everywhere; some notable extrapulmonary sites include
    lymph nodes (e.g., scrofula), bones and joints (e.g., Pott’s disease
    of the spine), pleura and pericardium, GU tract, and CNS. Dx can
    come from tissue culture and sometimes MTB PCR for more rapid
    detection (needs ID approval).

- TB-IRIS may be severe (esp with high infection burden) and hard to
    distinguish from TB treatment failure; can also be seen in
    adequately treated TB (provoked by the presence of dead bacteria)
    and undiagnosed latent TB.

- Disseminated MAC is usually diagnosed with AFB blood culture (only 1
    positive needed). Think about it in patients with uncontrolled HIV
    and severe immunosuppression (esp CD4 \<50), with unintentional
    weight loss, chronic diarrhea and/or dyspnea, and evidence of GI
    malabsorption or with bone marrow suppression

Extrapulmonary or disseminated Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcocosis, and
Coccidiodomycosis

- Can be difficult to distinguish based on clinical presentation and
    imaging alone. Diagnosed by culture and/or antigen testing depending
    on the organism and site of infection, and diagnosis may be
    supported by serologic studies.

- Initial treatment of choice: liposomal amphotericin B in almost all
    cases

Chronic mucocutaneous HSV

- Defined as mucocutaneous lesions present for \>1 month, can be
    present at any site

    Multicentric Castleman’s Disease

- See “Plasma Cell Dyscrasias” section in Hematology/Oncology for more
    details

NRTI Additional Information

- Tenofovir alone is indicated for HBV, in which case you should be
    mindful of renal clearance when dosing. In HIV, it is only used in
    combination with emtricitabine and third agent. Contraindicated if
    CrCl\<30

- Class-wide side effect: Lactic acidosis, steatosis and lipoatrophy
    (though very rare with contemporary NRTIs)

- Resistance: M184V confers high resistance to emtricitabine and
    lamivudine, mid-level resistance to abacavir, hypersusceptibility to
    tenofovir
