## Testing
-	Test patients with any new fever, cough, shortness of breath, loss of taste/smell, diarrhea/vomiting, or flu-like symptoms
-	Asymptomatic testing for SARS-COV-2 is no longer required for routine admissions or pre-procedures
-	Exceptions:
    -	Admission to 10 CCT, 11N, MCE6, and MCE7
    -	Pre-transplant pre-procedure planning
    -	May also be required by post-acute care facility prior to discharge
-	Would avoid retesting those with confirmed COVID-19 within the last 30 days unless they develop symptoms or fall within the exceptions due to risk of lingering detection without contagiousness or recurrent infection

## Evaluation of Admitted Patients with Symptomatic Acute COVID-19
-	Please refer to the hospital’s current maximum oxygen requirement allowed on the floor to ensure patient is appropriately triaged
-	Basic admission workup for symptomatic, confirmed COVID-19
    -	Labs: CBC with diff, CMP, D-dimer, Ferritin, CRP, ESR, PT/INR, PTT, procalcitonin
    -	Imaging: Portable CXR. Consider CTA PE if sudden or rapid worsening of hypoxia
    -	Nursing: Strict I/O’s to avoid pulmonary edema
    -	Enhanced precautions (contact, airborne, eye protection)

## Management
-	Fluid balance goal slightly net negative to even
-	Anticoagulation/DVT prophylaxis:
    -	Current guidelines suggest DVT ppx on admission
    -	Would only initiate treatment dose anticoagulation if confirmed DVT/PE

## Pharmacologic therapies
-	Note: Therapies, indications, and contraindications are frequently changing, please see latest VUMC/VA guidelines for specific indications for these medications or others. For VUMC, RedCap form is required prior to ordering Paxlovid or Remdesivir
-	Nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid)
    -	For use in symptomatic patients within 5 days of symptoms at high risk for progression to severe disease without significant drug interactions
    -	Contraindications:
        -	Risk of HIV resistance in patients with uncontrolled or undiagnosed HIV-1 infection
    -	Dosing:
        -	eGFR &gt; 60: nirmatrelvir 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) + ritonavir 100 mg (one 100mg tablet) BID x 5 days
        -	eGFR 30 to <60 mL/min: nirmatrelvir 150 mg (one 150 mg tablet) + ritonavir 100 mg (one 100 mg tablet) BID x 5 days
        -	eGFR <30 mL/min: use is not recommended
    -	Significant drug interactions
-	Remdesivir
    -	For use in patients hospitalized with COVID within 7 days of symptoms at high risk for progression to severe disease
    -	Contraindications: known hypersensitivity, ALT >/= 10x ULN, on mechanical ventilation or ECMO
    -	Dosing:
        -	Mild to moderate COVID-19 who may be admitted for other indications but are at high risk of progression to severe COVID 19:  loading dose 200mg IV x1 then 100mg IV q24h x 2 days. Course can be extending for a total of 5 days if patient progresses to severe COVID-19 (requiring supplemental oxygen)
        -	Severe COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen: loading dose 200mg IV x1 then 100mg daily x 4 days
    -	Monitoring: baseline CBC, INR, q48h CMP
    -	Do not need to remain in the hospital to complete course of Remdesivir
-	Dexamethasone
    -	For inpatient management of COVID-19 who require supplemental respiratory support (NC, non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, or ECMO)
    -	Dosing
        -	6mg PO/IV x 10 days; consideration of longer taper if no clinical improvement or persistently elevated CRP
        -	12mg Po/IV daily can be considered in those requiring >=10L who are clinically worsening despite 6 mg and who are not eligible for baricitinib or tocilizumab
    -	Contraindications: no hard contraindications, use clinical judgement if concomitant serious bacterial/fungal infection
-	Baricitinib (JAK inhibitor)
    -	Eligibility determined by ID and/or Pulm/Crit
    -	Use in those requiring >=6L or >40% FiO2, <=7 days since admission to the hospital, and/or clinical worsening despite steroids and supportive care
    -	Contraindications: hypersensitivity, concurrent treatment with tocilizumab, dialysis, ESRD, or acute anuric kidney injury, ALT>= 10x ULN, active TB or systemic fungal infection, or pregnancy
    -	Dosing:
        -	Would discuss with pharmacist if patient is taking an OAT3 inhibitor, otherwise dosing is based on eGFR
        -	For patients with eGFR > 60 ml/min: baricitinib 4 mg po daily
        -	For patients with eGFR 30-59 ml/min, baricitinib 2 mg po daily
        -	For patients with eGFR 15-29 ml/min, baricitinib 1 mg po daily
    -	To be administered for 14 days or until hospital discharge
    -	Monitoring: CBC w/ diff and CMP at baseline
    -	Adverse events: thrombosis, elevated LFTs, severe infection 2/2 lymphopenia and neutropenia
-	Tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor)
    -	Eligibility determined by ID and/or Pulm/Crit
    -	Adjunctive therapy for those who are not eligible with baricitinib
    -	Contraindications: hypersensitivity, recent hx of diverticulitis, history of bowel perforation, demyelinating disorders, ALT>= 5x ULN, ANC <500, Plt <50k, active bacterial, fungal, or viral infection other with COVID-19
    -	DOSING: 8mg/kg, up to max of 800mg IV, once
    -	Adverse events: Bowel perforation, elevated lipids, elevated LFTs, serious infections
-	Antibiotics:
    -	Consider CAP coverage if evidence of PNA on imaging or lack of improvement despite supportive care
    -	Can also use procalcitonin to guide decision though procal may be elevated in severe COVID-19 infection without concomitant bacterial infection

## Discharge Recommendations
-	Typical discharge criteria for respiratory illness requiring supplemental oxygen 
-	If patient was hospitalized FOR COVID-19, Patients should self-isolate x 20 days after the test was obtained AND until improving and fever-free x 24 hours
    -	If hospitalized WITH COVID-19 (i.e. hospitalized for other indications and required remdesivir and/or steroids), would isolate for 10 days after test was obtained
-	Consider telehealth PCP f/u
-	May be seen in-person at clinic after they have completed the required isolation
-	Consider a referral to home health 

## Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Adults (MIS-A)
-	Consider in those with fever with unclear etiology, history of previous COVID-19 diagnosis 2-8 weeks prior, and laboratory evidence of organ dysfunction
-	See VUMC COVID-19 Guidance for MIS-A for full diagnostic criteria
-	Treatment: IVIG, steroids, and DVT ppx
