# Endocarditis

## Background
-	Multiple etiologies of endocarditis:
    -	Typical Bacterial
        -	S. aureus, Enterococcus spp (E. faecalis most commonly), viridans group streptococci, Strep gallolyticus (formerly S. bovis)
        -	HACEK: Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella
    -	Other infectious
        -	Culture negative: often recent antimicrobial exposure, slow growing organism
        -	Coxiella, Brucella, Bartonella, Chlamydia, Legionella, Mycoplasma, Tropheryma whipplei, Cutibacterium acnes (formerly P. acnes)
        -	Fungal: Candida and aspergillus most common
    -	Non-infectious: a.k.a., marantic endocarditis, Libbman-Sacks Endocarditis
        -	Rare, most common in advanced malignancy, SLE, inflammatory conditions
        -	Higher risk for embolization compared to IE
        -	Risk factors: IV drug use, congenital heart disease, valve abnormalities, intracardiac devices, recent cardiac surgery

## Presentation
-	Fever (90%), murmur (85%), other: splenomegaly, splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, Roth spots
-	Persistent bacteremia despite appropriate treatment, new onset cardiac dysfunction, new onset valve abnormalities, stroke, other thromboembolic events, metastatic infections/abscesses, splenic abscess, septic pulmonary emboli

## Duke Criteria:
-	Pathologic Criteria
    -	Microorganisms: culture or histology proven: vegetation, embolus, or intracardiac abscess
    -	Pathologic vegetations: vegetation of abscess with histology proven endocarditis 
-	Clinical Criteria
    -	Definite: 2 Major, 1 major and 3 minor, or 5 minor
    -	Possible: 1 major and 1 minor, or 3 minor
    -	Rejected: firm alternate diagnosis, resolution of evidence with <4 days of antibiotics, or absence of pathologic evidence with <4days of antibiotics

## Evaluation
-	Physical exam: murmur, decreased peripheral perfusion, evidence of heart failure, petechiae, splinter hemorrhages, Janeway lesions/Osler nodes, organomegaly
-	Blood cultures: at least three sets from different sites over a span of several hours
-	Echo (TTE vs TEE)
    -	It can be reasonable to start with TEE if pretest probability is high enough, if pt already has known valvular abnormalities, or TTE will be technically difficult
-	EKG: new heart block or prolonged PR raises concern for endocardial/perivalvular abscess. Endocarditis pts should be on telemetry, monitored closely by team.
-	CXR: infiltrates suggestive of septic pulmonary emboli, pulmonary edema, cardiomegaly
-	Imaging of distant affected site if concerned for septic emboli
-	Other advanced imaging in select scenario: cardiac CTA, cardiac MRI, FDG-PET/CT 

## Management
-	Empiric antibiotics:
    -	If bacteria isolated from blood, reference bacteremia section for abx choice
    -	If awaiting cultures
        -	Native valve: Vancomycin +/- GNR coverage (depending on clinical stability, risk factors, etc)
        -	Prosthetic valve: Vancomycin and cefepime, consider gentamicin
-	Antibiotic Duration: determined by ID, often 4-6 weeks
-	Cardiac surgery consult: if valve dysfunction, perivalvular abscess, large (>20mm) vegetations, heart block, ongoing embolization on abx, delayed Cx clearance (>1 week on abx)

## Additional Information: 
-	Complications:
    -	Cardiac:
        -	Heart failure:  usually secondary to valve dysfunction. Most common when aortic valve involved, risk also depends on organism (worst is Staph aureus)
        -	Perivalvular abscess: suspect when there are conduction abnormalities on EKG.
        -	Pericarditis: can be suppurative or non-suppurative
        -	Intracardiac Fistula
    -	Septic emboli and metastatic abscesses
    -	Mycotic aneurysm: usually occurs at vessel branch points
-	Follow Up
    -	Repeat TTE at completion of treatment to establish new baseline
    -	Followed for valvular dysfunction with frequency determined by nature of the dysfunction
    -	Regular dental care; prior IE is an indication for SBE prophylaxis with dental work.
-	Episode of IE is an indication for PDA or VSD closure
