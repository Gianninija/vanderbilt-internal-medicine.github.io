## Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB)

-	Micro profile: small, aerobic, acid-fast bacillus 
-	Epidemiology overview: 8,331 reported TB cases in US in 2022 per CDC. Up to 13 million people living in the US with latent TB. 
-	Terminology: some discrepancies / evolution of language around TB
    -	Active tuberculosis (now often called Tuberculosis Disease)
    -	Latent TB Infection (now often called Tuberculosis Infection)
-	Transmission: inhalation of aerosolized droplets from an infected individual 
-	Possible outcomes of this exposure/transmission:
    -	Immediate clearance by host defenses
    -	Primary TB Disease
    -	TB infection (Latent Disease) 
-	Presentations
    -	TB Disease (Active TB)
        -	Primary TB (after first exposure)
            -	Fever, cough, pleuritic chest pain
            -	CXR: hilar/mediastinal LAD, pulmonary consolidation, pleural effusion. Some patients can present with isolated pulmonary cavitations.
        -	Reactivation (post primary TB, years after exposure often)
            -	Presents more insidiously: fever, cough, malaise, weight loss, dyspnea. There is an overlap with primary TB.
            -	CXR: usually involves apical and posterior upper lobe consolidations, often with cavitations
        -	Extrapulmonary manifestations: lymphadenitis, pericarditis (can cause tamponade), genitourinary (can cause infertility even in women), peritoneal involvement, and CNS involvement
            -	Disseminated TB
                -	Also referred to as miliary TB. Can range from acute to chronic in presentation.
                -	Dissemination is more often seen in immunocompromised hosts (including patients with HIV/AIDS). 
    - TB Infection (Latent Disease)
        - Asymptomatic by definition
        - The immune system has contained any active disease such that individuals are not infectious
        - CXR may show old, healed tuberculosis but patient has no history of treatment. This patient would be very high risk for reactivation.
-	Testing & Diagnosis
    -	Who to test?
        -	Clinical judgement is key
        -	In general, think about patients about to go on TNF-alpha blocker or a similar biologic, patients with malignancies, patients with newly diagnosed or undiagnosed HIV, patients at high risk due to living conditions (unhoused individuals in shelters, incarcerated patients).
    -	Tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) are often used for screening purposes
        -	If someone had the BCG vaccine, cannot use TST
    -	If you are concerned for symptomatic TB disease, need to get 2 AFB sputum samples with Xpert testing (i.e. PCR testing) before can come off TB precautions
        -	TST and IGRA should not be used as reliable tests for TB disease
        -	Xpert MTB/RIF detects the MTB rproB gene. Also detects rifampin resistance.
            -	98% sensitive for a single sputum specimen in smear-positive culture-positive cases; approximately 70% sensitive for smear negative culture-positive cases (this increases to 90% if you test 3 samples).
-	Treatment:
    -	TB Infection (Latent TB):
        -	Different options:
            -	Rifampin (RIF) daily for 4 months (4R)
            -	Isoniazid (INH) and RIF daily for 3 months (3HR)
            -	INH and rifapentine (RPT) weekly for 3 months (3HP)
            -	INH for 6-9 months (alternative if contraindication to rifamycins)
    -	TB Disease:
        -	Multi drug regimen for at least 6 months for pulmonary TB
            -	INH, RIF, pyrazinamide (PZA), and ethambutol (EMB) for 2 months followed by INH and RIF for 4 more months
        -	For CNS involvement: 12 months of therapy plus steroids
        -	For bone and joint involvement: 6-9 months of therapy
        -	For certain patients with drug-susceptible TB confined to pulmonary system: new recommendation that can do a 4-month course where rifapentine (RPT) and moxifloxacin (MOX)
            -	2 months of RPT, INH, PZA, and MOX, followed by 9-weeks of RPT, INH, and MOX
        -	If patient has HIV, remember that TB meningitis is one of the infections most likely to result in IRIS, so ART initiation is held in this case
        -	These treatment summaries are for non-pregnant patients

## Non tubercular mycobacterium (NTM)

-	These are mycobacteria species that do not cause tuberculosis or leprosy 
-	Ubiquitous in the environment 
-	Most well-known species: mycobacterium avium complex (MAC)
-	NTM manifestations in patients:
    -	Pulmonary disease
        -	Pulmonary MAC
            -	Presents usually with cough, weight loss, fatigue
            -	Often occurs in patients with underlying lung disease (bronchiectasis, COPD) or patients with prior TB
            -	Another common phenotype: women > 50 who are nonsmokers
            -	More likely to have CFTR mutations
            -	Common imaging findings: nodules, bronchiectasis, and/or cavities
            -	Diagnosis: symptoms, imaging findings, 2 positive sputum samples with NTM growth or 1+ bronchial washing (if patient symptomatic)
      -	Disseminated infections
          -	Most often seen with HIV/AIDS
          -	Disseminated MAC presents usually with fever, night sweats, weight loss
          -	End organ involvement: bone marrow (manifesting as cell line derangements), adenopathy/hepatosplenomegaly, GI (manifesting as diarrhea, abdominal pain), and pulmonary
          -	Diagnosis: AFB blood cultures, culture & staining/path from end organ areas of involvement (i.e. bone marrow biopsy)
    -	NTM infections can also present as superficial lymphadenitis or skin infections 
-	Treatment
    -	Depends on macrolide susceptibility
        -	For pulmonary MAC: 3 drug regimen consisting of a macrolide (usually azithromycin), a rifamycin (usually rifampin), and ethambutol.
            -	Aminoglycoside also sometimes used depending on type of pulmonary disease
        -	Duration of treatment is usually 15-18 months. Depends on how quickly patients can clear their cultures as you need treatment until 2 consecutive sputum cultures are negative for at least 12 months
        -	Disseminated disease treatment is more complicated and is affected by ART often in patients with HIV, so reach out to ID
            -	ART should be started in individuals with new HIV diagnosis as soon as MAC treatment is started (unless another co-infection prevents this due to risk of IRIS)
