# Joint Infections and Osteomyelitis

## Background: 
-	If high concern for septic arthritis, engage Ortho before ID. Needs arthrocentesis +/- wash out.
-	ESR/CRP are helpful but nonspecific in diagnosing bone/joint infections 

## Presentation
-	Septic arthritis: erythema, effusion, limited ROM and pain with passive and active ROM
-	Osteomyelitis: often underlying a wound (diabetic foot ulcer, sacral decubitus ulcer) but may be hematogenous as well; probe to bone positivity is diagnostic for osteomyelitis 

## Evaluation 
-	CBC (leukocytosis), ESR, CRP 
-	Blood cultures 
-	Imaging: start with X-ray --> if radiograph is negative for osteo, cannot rule out, need to get MRI. Very helpful if it’s picked up on X-ray though due to specificity
-	Fluid studies & gram stain results from synovial fluid if concerned for septic arthritis: usually WBC > 20,000 cells/ microL 

## Management
-	If pt is sick, don’t wait for culture data to start empiric antibiotics
    -	Gram positives: empiric coverage with vancomycin until ID and sensitivities; MRSA nares being negative does not rule out MRSA skin/soft tissue infection
    -	Gram negatives: empiric coverage with ceftriaxone or cefepime if concerned for Pseudomonas. 
-	If concern for septic arthritis, consult Ortho, hold AC 
-	If a pt has a foot wound with underlying osteomyelitis, talk to Podiatry/Ortho for deep tissue biopsy. If clinically stable, hold abx.
    -	IR and CT/US guided procedures don’t really do bone biopsies, so talk to surgical specialty first
-	Osteomyelitis abx duration: usually 6 weeks, but can do PO antibiotics based on susceptibilities, ID follow up
-	Septic arthritis abx duration: usually 3-4 weeks

## Additional information: 
-	Septic arthritis mimic: gout / CPPD --> obtain crystal analysis with synovial studies
-	Less common causes of septic arthritis: gonococcal, Lyme disease (order serologies if suspicion is high)
