# Pulmonary Infections - VASP

---

## Acute Bronchitis

### Background
-	1-3 wks productive cough, often preceded by URI, may have wheezing/rhonchi
-	Distinct from chronic bronchitis (>3 mos of consecutive cough x 2 consecutive yrs)
-	Distinct from PNA (parenchymal consolidation, fever >100.4F, hypoxia, tachypnea)
-	DDx: COVID-19, post-nasal drip, GERD, undertreated/new asthma, ACE-i induced bradykinin cough, undertreated CHF, acute PE, or new lung cancer
-	Typically a clinical dx; CXR/labs not necessary unless PNA suspected
### Management
-	Supportive: lozenges, cough suppressants (guaifenesin or dextromethorphan), smoking cessation. Consider albuterol inhaler for wheezing
-	No indication for antibiotics

## Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)

See CAP algorithm on VASP website

### Background
-	All PNA that does not otherwise meet criteria for Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (PNA that develops ≥48 hours after hospital admission), Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (PNA that develops ≥48-72 hours after endotracheal intubation), or aspiration PNA
-	Healthcare-associated pneumonia is no longer a clinical entity per 2016 IDSA guidelines
-	MRSA Risk Factors:
    -	Recent history of MRSA
    -	Cavitary lesion or necrotizing pneumonia
    -	Post-influenza bacterial PNA
    -	Pts with IDU
    -	Severe hypoxemia requiring intubation
-	Pseudomonas Risk Factors:
    -	Recent history of Pseudomonas
    -	Bronchiectasis or structural lung disease
-	Both MRSA and Pseudomonas Risk Factors:
    -	Hospitalization AND IV antibiotics in previous 90 days
    -	Immunocompromising conditions 
-	*Double coverage for Pseudomonas is not indicated in general population; LVQ has 82% sensitivity so not recommended unless isolate proven susceptible

### Evaluation
-	Sputum cultures prior to abx, consider BCx in select groups (severe pna, ICU admission, cavitary disease, immunosuppression). 
-	Rule out flu if the right season, COVID-19, consider RVP if it will change management
-	CURB-65 or PSI can aid in decision between outpt vs inpt therapy
    -	CURB-65: Confusion, Uremia (BUN >=19mg/dL), RR (>30/min), BP(<90/60), Age ≥ 65 If ≥ 2, hospitalization is recommended. 
-	Consider urine pneumococcal Ag, urine Legionella Ag in severe CAP and in certain pts (e.g., neutropenia, asplenia, obstructive lung disease, hyponatremia, diarrhea, or heavy ETOH); 
-	CRP, ESR, and pro-calc have not been shown to reliably improve outcomes; however, pro-calcitonin < 0.25 suggests against bacterial respiratory infection and antibiotic discontinuation is encouraged	
-	PA/ lateral CXR. If immunocompromised, consider CT chest w/o contrast (does not improve outcomes)
    -	Lobar Consolidation - likely bacterial
    -	Interstitial Infiltrate - likely atypical vs. viral vs. non-infectious
    -	Cavitation - concerning for fungal vs. necrotizing vs. mycobacterial

### Management
-	Antibiotic Duration: 5-7 days (at least 5 days and improvement with clinical stability) 
-	Outpatient management
    -	Low Risk (no chronic heart, lung, liver, renal disease, DM, alcoholism, immunocompromise)
        -	Amoxicillin 1g TID
    -	High Risk
        -	Amox/clav 875/125 mg BID
        -	Cefuroxime 500 mg BID
        -	Levofloxacin 750 mg daily
-	Inpatient management

-	Anaerobic Coverage: Do NOT start metronidazole or clindamycin for aspiration pneumonia. Anaerobic coverage should be considered if empyema or lung abscess detected.
-	Transition to PO as soon as patient able to tolerate PO medications and is clinically improving. If patient has concurrent bacteremia, transition after at least 3 days of IV antibiotics.

### Additional Information
-	MRSA nasal swab has reported negative predictive value for MRSA pneumonia ranging 95% to >99%; consider sending and if negative, discontinue MRSA agent
-	CTX is generally adequate coverage for aspiration PNA without evidence of abscess, empyema, or cavitary lesion on imaging
-	Aspiration pneumonitis does not require abx. Rapid resolution of leukocytosis and stabilization of vitals suggest aspiration pneumonitis.
-	There is low sensitivity of S. pneumoniae to azithromycin (42%) and doxycycline (72%), so these should not be used as monotherapy
-	Check for drug interactions with linezolid (e.g., SSRI, methadone, methamphetamine use)

## Hospital Acquired Pnuemonia (HAP) and Ventilator Associated Pnuemonia (VAP)

See HAP/VAP algorithm on VASP website

### Background
-	HAP: Pneumonia that develops >48 hours after admission
-	VAP: Pneumonia that develops >48 hours after endotracheal intubation 

### Evaluation
-	Cultures of blood, sputum, endotracheal aspirate and/or bronchoscopy specimen
-	Consider MRSA nares to help with de-escalation
-	If there is concern for respiratory viruses: send SARS-CoV-2/influenza/RSV (RPP may be considered for immunocompromised patients)

### Management
-	Initially cover for MRSA and Pseudomonas 
-	Antibiotic Duration: 7 days in uncomplicated cases, although specific pathogens (e.g., Pseudomonas) may require longer duration and ID guidance
-	Consider ID consultation if the pt is not clinically improving on empiric therapy or if an MDR pathogen grows from culture
-	If no MRSA isolated and pt is improving, consider stopping vancomycin ASAP
-	There is concern for nephrotoxicity with combination Vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam, but data controversial

## Influenza

### Background
-	Dx often clinical w/cough, sore throat, sputum/nasal discharge, HA, fever, myalgias, and malaise; ± N/V/D. Exam with increased flushing, rarely with lower respiratory symptoms.

### Evaluation
-	During flu season: Obtain COVID/RPP or dedicated influenza PCR; testing is more accurate if obtained within 96 hour of symptom onset
-	CXR if concerned for bacterial superinfection

### Management
-	Antivirals most effective when given <48 hours from symptom onset; however, recommended to be given if symptomatic despite duration and to all hospitalized pts
-	Oseltamivir 75mg BID x 5 days, peramivir 600mg IV x 1 (needs renal adjustment), or baloxavir (age ≥12) 40mg once (use 80 mg if >80kg)
-	Amantadine and rimantadine are no longer used due to emerging resistance
