# Fungal Infections 

Ally Glover

---

## Evaluation
-	Bacterial BCx can detect candidemia but low sensitivity (50%). Fungal blood cultures also with low sensitivity.  
-	Beta-d-glucan: note will not be elevated in mucormycosis, cryptococcosis, and blastomycosis.
-	Aspergillus galactomannan: BAL > serum. 
-	Pts with risk factors for candidemia (TPN, chronic line, GI disease, persistent neutropenic fever) with concerning clinical syndrome can be treated empirically with micafungin.

## Candida Infections

### Background 
-	Part of normal flora of human GI and GU tract
-	Broad range of associated diseases from vaginal candidiasis to candidemia
-	Pts at highest risk of severe / invasive candida infection (candidemia):
    -	Burn / surgical ICU pts
    -	Solid organ recipients
    -	Chemo pts / malignant heme pts
    -	TPN dependent / central access pts (especially in ICU) 

### Presentation 
-	Oropharyngeal: white plaques/patches in mouth +/- erythema, painful when eating
-	Esophageal: dysphagia/odynophagia, chest pain w/ swallowing 
-	Vulvovaginitis: white, thick discharge; pruritus/erythema 
-	Balanitis: white patches on penis with severe burning/itching
-	Mastitis:  breast feeding pts with nipple injury 
-	Invasive focal infections
    -	UTI: ascending infection (can often be unilateral) vs. hematologic source (micro abscesses)
    -	Peritonitis: often in peritoneal dialysis pts
    -	Mediastinitis: often post thoracic surgery
    -	Hepatosplenic: often in pts who just recovered from neutropenia in setting of heme malignancy 
-	Candidemia: sepsis, often in setting of critical illness, think about when above risk factors present 

### Evaluation
-	Blood: candida is NEVER a contaminant in blood cultures 
-	Urine: culture is standard method of identification but RARELY a urinary pathogen

### Management
-	Candidemia / critical illness: start micafungin 100mg daily, consult ID
-	Vulvovaginitis: fluconazole 150mg x1 if mild, 150mg every 72 hrs for 2-3 doses if severe
-	Oropharyngeal: nystatin oral suspension if mild thrush, if moderate – severe candidiasis then fluconazole 100-200mg qday for 7-14 days
-	Esophageal candidiasis (AIDS defining illness): fluconazole 200-400mg qday or micafungin 150mg daily for 14-21 days as an alternative agent

### Additional information 
-	Remember to check susceptibilities (C krusei has intrinsic azole resistance and C glabrata has high rates of fluconazole resistance)

## Aspergillosis
### Background
-	Most often in pts who have prolonged neutropenia, high dose steroids, or other immunosuppressive drug regimen or condition 
-	Take thorough hx: farming, occupational exposure where pt might have inhaled conidia

### Presentation
-	Classic pulmonary aspergillosis presentation: neutropenic pt with fever, pleuritic chest pain and hemoptysis
-	Tracheobronchitis: can occur in lung transplant pts 

### Evaluation 
-	Aspergillus galactomannan Ag 
-	Lung imaging if concerned for pulmonary aspergillosis
-	Differentiate possible vs probable vs proven (tissue) aspergillosis as it can reflect colonization without proper clinical syndrome or host 

### Management
-	Consult ID. Usually treat with voriconazole or other triazole (posaconazole, isavuconazole). Preferred over amphotericin based on clinical trials.
-	Fluconazole is NOT active against aspergillus

## Blastomycosis
### Background
-	Endemic in midwest, southeast, southern central US, and parts of Canada that border the Great Lakes
-	Mostly pulmonary manifestations, 25-40% of infections w/ extrapulmonary involvement (skin, bone, GU, and CNS presentations)

### Presentation
-	Pulmonary symptoms common: dyspnea, cough, fever, hemoptysis, chest pain
-	Verrucous lesions with irregular borders
-	Osteolytic bone lesions 
-	Draining sinuses 

### Evaluation: 
-	Serum and urine blastomycosis Ag
-	Antibody testing less useful in acute disease (interpret with caution)

### Management
-	Pulmonary blastomycosis
    -	Mild to Moderate: itraconazole 6-12 months
    -	Moderate to Severe: ampho followed by itraconazole for 6-12 months
-	Disseminated extrapulmonary blastomycosis: ampho followed by itraconazole for a year
    -	Note: in anyone who is immunosuppressed, especially pts with AIDS, start with amphotericin
-	CNS blastomycosis: 4-6 weeks of ampho followed by a year of itraconazole

## Histoplasmosis
### Background 
-	The most common endemic mycosis in the US. Endemic to Ohio and Mississippi river valley. 
-	Most infections are not clinically significant / do not require treatment. 
-	At risk for disseminated disease (HIV, transplant recipients, immunocompromised, TNF- alpha inhibitors, elderly) 
-	Differential diagnosis: TB, malignancy, sarcoidosis, other fungal infection

### Presentation
-	Pulmonary histo: pna w/ mediastinal or hilar LND or masses, pulmonary nodules, cavitation
-	Disseminated histo: fever, mediastinal LND, diffuse pulm interstitial infiltrates, HSM, liver involvement, popular rash, cytopenias, mucosal lesions,  LDH, ferritin, adrenal involvement, colonic involvement. 

### Evaluation
-	Send BOTH Urine and Serum antigens. Requires attending name to order. 
-	Antibody testing less useful in acute disease (interpret with caution)
-	Other diagnostics to consider: peripheral smear/buffy coat, fungal blood cultures, LDH, ferritin, BAL with cultures and cytology 
-	Remember histo Ag has high cross reactivity with blasto Ag

### Management: 
-	Amphotericin and Itraconazole- discuss with ID, pharmacy about dosing, duration. 
-	Pulmonary histo:
    -	Mediastinal granuloma, fibrosis, broncholithiasis: usually no tx.
    -	Mild-moderate acute pulmonary histo: itraconazole if persistent symptoms > 1mo
    -	Chronic cavitations: itraconazole, likely 1 to 2 years
    -	Severe acute pulmonary histo: amphotericin for 1-2 weeks +/- methylprednisolone followed by itraconazole for 12 weeks
-	Disseminated histo:
    -	Mild-moderate disseminated disease: itraconazole for ~12 months
    -	Severe disseminated disease: ampho for 1-2 weeks followed by itraconazole for ~12 mo 

### Additional information
-	Disseminated histoplasmosis can be associated with secondary HLH. Follow CBC closely. 
-	If concerned for sarcoidosis, need to rule out histo prior to starting treatment for sarcoidosis 
-	Urine antigen can be used to trend response to treatment
