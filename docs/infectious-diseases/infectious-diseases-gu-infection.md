# Genitourinary Infection – VASP

---

## Asymptomatic Bacteriuria

### Background
-	Isolation of bacteria in an appropriately collected urine specimen from an individual without symptoms or signs of urinary tract infection. Bacteriuria, foul odor, urine appearance, pyuria, falls and/or confusion alone are not indicative of infection. 
-	Oliguric ESRD pts may have bacteriuria from colonization due to lack of flushing of bladder; avoid sending UA/UCx unless pt is symptomatic
-	Treatment only required for specific populations:
    -	Pregnant women (screening performed at 12 – 16 weeks)
    -	Anticipated urologic intervention - when requesting, be sure to ask for Micro help in identifying potential pathogens needing treatment vs. likely contaminants
    -	Some renal transplant recipients, depending on time since transplant

## Complicated UTI and Pyelonephritis

See UTI algorithm on VASP website

### Background
-	Fever, pyuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness suggest pyelonephritis. 
-	Consider it a complicated UTI if any of the following are present:
    -	Renal calculi or other obstructive disease, immunosuppressed host, abnormal urological anatomy or physiology (including stents), presence of a urinary catheter
    -	Male sex alone does NOT qualify as complicated
    -	Sepsis or bacteremia

### Evaluation
-	UA with reflex urine culture ONLY in patients with symptoms
-	If unable to obtain history, evaluate for objective signs of infection (fever, hypotension, tachycardia, leukocytosis, etc.) and evaluate for alternative explanations (O2 requirement suggest pneumonia, post-op fever within 48 hours, etc.)
-	BCx and UCx prior to abx 
-	If there is no pyuria, consider an alternative diagnosis, or proximal ureteral obstruction
    -	Pyuria is common in the presence of a urinary catheter, kidney stones, urostomy, ileal conduit and other invasive devices, and may not indicate infection

### Management
-	Antibiotic Duration: 7-14 days, depending on antibiotic choice
-	Tailor therapy once/if cultures are available. If no improvement in 48h, consider imaging to rule out complications (e.g., perinephric abscess)
    -	Transition from IV to PO should be considered for patients who meet the following criteria: able to tolerate enteral medications, signs of clinical improvement (defervesced, afebrile, down-trending WBC, etc.)
    -	Days of IV therapy count towards overall treatment duration.

*FQ’s have same bioavailability if given PO or IV so oral is preferred

## Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection

### Background
-	Clinical symptoms of UTI (dysuria/urgency/frequency/ hematuria) in non-pregnant, immunocompetent, neurologically intact pt with normal urologic anatomy and no indwelling urinary catheters
Management
-	Empiric therapy
    -	Nitrofurantoin monohydrate: 100 mg PO BID x 5 days (avoid if any concern for pyelonephritis or if creatinine clearance <30)
    -	Cephalexin 250-500mg q6h x5-7 days
-	Alternative therapies
    -	Fosfomycin: 3 grams of powder mixed in water as a single PO dose (avoid if any concern for ascending UTI or pyelonephritis). Susceptibility test results must be requested, only possible for E. coli and E. Faecalis.
    -	Amoxicillin-clavulanate: 875-125mg PO BID x5-7 days
    -	Ciprofloxacin: 250mg PO BID x3 days
        -	FQ’s should be reserved for more serious infections than uncomplicated cystitis, and only after susceptibility results are confirmed given high rates of resistance
        -	Adverse effect profile >> beta-lactams (i.e. QT-prolongation, tendinopathies)
-	Avoid amoxicillin, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) due to increasing resistance unless culture data with confirmed susceptibility
Additional Information
-	MDR cystitis: ESBL isolates are increasingly common due to antibiotic overuse
    -	Before treating, decide if this is a TRUE UTI
    -	If true, consider Fosfomycin (if E. coli) or nitrofurantoin (if susceptibility is confirmed – K. pneumoniae and Enterobacter spp are usually resistant), gentamicin or tobramycin 5 mg/kg IV once (even in setting of AKI), or ID consultation
    -	Ask the lab to check susceptibility results to these antibiotics for future reference

## Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI)

### Background
-	Culture growth of > 103 cfu/mL of uropathogenic bacteria + signs or symptoms consistent with infection (without another identified etiology) + indwelling urethral/suprapubic catheter or intermittent catheterization.
    -	This includes pts with catheters in place during the preceding 48 hours 
-	Duration = greatest risk factor (increases 3-10% per day of catheterization)
    -	Other risks: female sex, diabetes, elderly, colonization of catheter bag, poor care 
-	Bacteriuria, foul odor, pyuria, urine appearance falls and/or confusion alone are not indicative of infection in pts who are otherwise asymptomatic. 
-	Ensure clean sample collected
    -	Ideally, catheter is removed and midstream sample obtained
    -	If catheterization required; removal of old catheter and sample taken from new catheter

### Management
-	Distinguish uncomplicated vs complicated UTI (see above) 
-	Antimicrobial management:
    -	Guided by cultures and susceptibilities
    -	Duration: 7 – 14 days depending on abx, clinical response and whether infection constitutes complicated vs uncomplicated UTI
    -	Special note regarding Candida UTI management: Candida is generally not pathogenic
        -	Presence in urine does not indicate infection (unless perinephric abscess, renal transplant, or complex fistulous disease)
        -	Fluconazole achieves excellent urinary penetration while micafungin does not
        -	If fluconazole-resistant Candida is cultured or suspected, consult ID
        -	Susceptibilities are not routinely run-on Candida from urine cultures and would need to be requested if concern for true infection.
-	Catheter management
    -	At the least, catheters should be replaced at the time of antibiotic initiation (preferably removed).
    -	If catheterization is necessary, intermittent catheterization is preferred over continuous use with pt educations on cleaning/hygiene prior to catheterization. Condom catheters and pure wicks also preferred over foley catheter.
