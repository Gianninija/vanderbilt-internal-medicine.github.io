Code Status Discussion – Katie Sunthankar

- The approach to obtaining someone’s code status should be thoughtful
    and pertinent to their current admission or recent change in
    clinical status

<!-- -->

- Ask yourself “Why would this patient code? Is resuscitation a
    reversible treatment in this patient’s case? What are the chances
    that this patient will survive to discharge following CPR? Is the
    anticipated outcome in line with the patient’s goals?

- After you have made your assessment, help patient make an educated
    decision based on both the efficacy of resuscitation and the
    patient’s goals

<!-- -->

- Below are examples of phrases that can be used in framing code
    status.

<!-- -->

- NEVER say “Do you want us to do everything?” Most patients will
    respond yes to this even if they do not want CPR

- It is more helpful to give examples of when these situations would
    arise and make recommendations based on your medical judgment
    factoring in patient's goals

Admitting a patient:

- **Introduction**: Normalize the conversation by stating “these are
    questions we routinely ask everyone when they come into the
    hospital. This is a way for us to understand your wishes in the
    event you are unable to make your own decisions.”

- **Surrogate**: “If you were unable to make decisions for yourself,
    who would you trust to make your decisions? The person you pick
    should be able to speak to your wishes and make the same choices you
    would make for yourself”

- \-**Intubation**: Always do this first so you can avoid the sticky
    DNI but not DNR situation. Again, normalize the question. “Everyone
    has different opinions on what types of medical care they would want
    if they became sicker. One of the things we like to talk about are
    ventilators or breathing machines. Some tell us to try a breathing
    machine for a trial, but they would not want to be kept alive on a
    ventilator.” Now make a recommendation. “In your case I think if you
    were to need a ventilator, I think it would \[work, not work,\]”
    Pause and allow them to ask questions. Also remember that if they
    say DNI, then they must be DNR because intubation occurs with ACLS
    (this is not allowed at VUMC. It is technically allowed at the VA if
    the patient specifically requests but would not recommend routinely
    providing this option)

- **CPR**: Prime this question with “The next question I have to ask
    you can be hard to think about, but it is important that we know
    what you would want in an emergency. Specifically, if you had a
    cardiac arrest where your heart stops beating and you die, would you
    want chest compressions to try and restart your heart? We know based
    on the evidence that CPR is not always successful. It really depends
    on the situation. In your case, I think CPR would be (make a
    recommendation here). Knowing this, would you want us to attempt CPR
    to resuscitate you?”

<!-- -->

- A helpful way to share data about the success of CPR: “Can I share
    some numbers about how often CPR can help?” Sometimes using fingers
    to show these numbers helps. “If you take 10 people in this hospital
    and all of their hearts stop beating, which would mean they have
    died, and we get to them as fast as possible, only 3 of them would
    have their hearts restarted and only 1 of them would ever leave the
    hospital.”

What if you do not think performing CPR Is medically appropriate?…

- At the end of the day, it is their decision (attendings may change
    the code status out of medical futility in Tennessee)

- Code status can be revisited throughout the hospital stay,
    especially if the patient was initially overwhelmed or if their
    clinical status evolves. Sometimes patients find it helpful to have
    a family member or friend present

- Consider framing the discussion differently and offer your
    recommendation: “While you are in the hospital, we will support you
    with interventions and medications that we think are helpful based
    on what you have told us important to you. However, we are worried
    that some of the interventions you are asking for may do more harm
    than good. Many people think that CPR works like it does on TV.
    Unfortunately, we know that most patients who need CPR in the
    hospital do not survive like they do on TV. In your case, we do not
    think it would bring you back to your current state. I worry that
    this is not something that will be helpful to you.”

- Another phrase that is helpful (and when the discussion occurs with
    surrogates leads to higher rates of changing code status than saying
    DNR): “allow for a natural death”. For example, “I worry that given
    how sick your \[loved one\] is, that the additional interventions of
    CPR if she were to die, would prevent her from having a natural
    death”

Conversion:

- Transition between opiates is done using oral morphine equivalents
    (OMEs). Each drugs’ potency is compared to oral morphine (see
    table). Ex: 1 mg IV morphine = 3 mg PO morphine

- When transitioning, doses are traditionally reduced by 1/4 to 1/3
    due to cross tolerance

- IR/ER regimens: Consider switching to extended release when
    requiring 3-4 doses of intermediate release (IR) medications in a
    24-hour period regularly. The ER medication should treat the chronic
    pain experienced by a patient. The IR preparation is indicated for
    breakthrough pain. The IR dose should be calculated as 10-20% of the
    total OME dose a patient takes daily. Fentanyl patches should last
    72 hours

Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCAs)

- Pumps can be programmed to deliver a continuous rate and/or a bolus
    dose

<!-- -->

- Basal rate = a continuous infusion dosed per hour that cannot be
    adjusted by the patient

- Demand dose = a patient-directed bolus that is given at a prescribed
    frequency whenever the pt presses the button. Both the dose and
    frequency can be adjusted

- The general rule of thumb is to calculate the total OME delivered
    through the demand when a pt is in steady state and convert 75% of
    this dose into the total continuous rate.

    Calculating initial doses:

<!-- -->

- Basal dose: check what the patient is actually taking at home (may
    be different than what is prescribed, use OME). Take the total daily
    dose and convert to IV and then divide that by 24 hours to get an
    hourly rate. If moderate pain, increase dose by 25-50%; if severe,
    by 50-100%

- Demand doses: The bolus dose should be 10-20% of total daily dose.
    The availability is based on half-life of the medication (2hr for
    IV). Adjust the availability based on how frequently you want
    patient to be able to have a demand dose (ex: if q10min divide by 12
    or if q15min divide by 8 for 2 hours)

- Don’t forget to set lock-outs (maximum dose that can be given over a
    certain period of time) that includes both basal and demand doses

- Remember that the basal rate will not get to steady state for at
    least 8 hrs; When you admit pts or are transitioning pts to a PCA,
    always initiate the PCA pump with a bolus (or loading) dose

How to Order PCA at VUMC

- Select Analgesic:

<!-- -->

- \*Hydromorphone (most common): Order “Hydromorphone (DILAUDID) PCA”

- Fentanyl (if on at home; not a good inpatient PCA): Order “Fentanyl
    PCA”

- \*Morphine: Order “Morphine PCA”

<!-- -->

- Select “\[Analgesic\] PCA syringe” and adjust the following to pt
    needs:

<!-- -->

- PCA Dose (“Demand”): amount the patient gets when s/he presses the
    button

- Lockout Interval: time between which “demand” doses will not be
    administered if s/he presses the button (i.e., the PCA “locks out”)

- Continuous Dose (“Basal”): amount the pt gets per hr in continuous
    infusion

- Max Dose: maximum amount of analgesic (Basal + Demand) pt can get in
    24 hours

<!-- -->

- Select all “PCA Nursing Orders”

How to Order PCA at VA

- Under Orders, select “Pain/Sedation Infusions”

- Under “PCAs,” select Analgesic of choice (Hydromorphone or Morphine)

- Adjust the following:

<!-- -->

- Load: amount the pt will receive on initial set up of PCA

- Basal: amount the pt gets per hour in continuous infusion

- Demand: amount the pt gets when s/he presses the button

Interrogating PCA (to determine amount of analgesia pt received):

- Look at IV pump display and hit “Channel Select” on PCA

- Select “Options” in bottom left of IV pump

- Select “Patient History” on the left of the screen. This shows the
    administration history for a certain time period (e.g., 24h, 12h,
    4h, etc.)

- Hit “Zoom” on bottom of screen to change time period to 24 hours.
    Should show:

<!-- -->

- Total Drug: total amount of drug received in last 24 hours

- Total Demands: amount of times the pt has pushed the button for
    demand dose

- Delivered: amount of times the pt actually received a demand dose

- The difference between “Total Demands” and “Delivered” is the number
    of times the patient pushed the button without receiving a dose

Opioid Side effects

- Constipation: dose-dependent and will not develop tolerance. If pt
    has opioids, they need robust bowel regimen (MiraLAX, senna) with
    goal of BM ≥every 3 days

<!-- -->

- For opioid-specific constipation can do SQ Relistor<sup>TM</sup>
    (methylnaltrexone) but this is expensive and can only be given in
    the PCU or oncology floors at VUMC. For patients with chronic
    opioid-induced constipation as an outpatient can trial oral agents
    like Movantik<sup>TM</sup> (naloxgeol). Can also consider PO
    naloxone but it does have small amount of bioavailability so watch
    for systemic reversal

<!-- -->

- Nausea: occurs with opiate naïve pts. Consider starting an
    anti-emetic concurrently. Most pts will develop tachyphylaxis with
    this over a day, so the antiemetic can be discontinued

- Urinary retention: Consider role of opioids in pts with new-onset or
    worsening urinary retention. Try to de-escalate opioid dosing if
    possible

- Overdose: In pts with apneic emergency, IV 0.4 mg Naloxone; however,
    low threshold for multiple doses until response. For pts prescribed
    opioids as outpatient, need naloxone 4 mg intranasal

<!-- -->

- If a patient with chronic opiate dependence is over sedated but not
    in immediate danger of respiratory failure, one can 1) hold the dose
    of opioid and let them wake up on their own or 2) give a dose of
    naloxone 0.02-0.04mg (1/10 of the usual dose). This latter strategy
    prevents opioid withdrawal and precipitation of pain crisis in
    patients on chronic opioids

<!-- -->

- Pruritis: due to histamine release from mast cells; can be treated
    with antihistamines. The opioid can also be rotated. Some but not
    all pts will develop tachyphylaxis to this symptom

- Toxicity: hyperalgesia and neuroexcitatory effects (AMS, myoclonic
    jerking, seizures). Risk factors for neuroexcitatory effects are
    rapid titration, dehydration, and/or renal failure. Treatment is to
    rotate to a higher potency opioid and hydrate when possible

Acute and Chronic Pain – Thomas Horton, Soibhan Kelley

- There are physiological AND emotional components to pain.
    Biopsychosocial factors must be addressed. Ex: anxiety/depression,
    physical debility, and poor social support. Many pts will never be
    completely free of pain, so it is important to set realistic
    expectations

- Central sensitization is a phenomenon where the nervous system
    persists in a state of high reactivity which lowers the threshold
    for pain stimuli. Two characteristics of centralized pain are
    allodynia (pain from non-painful stimuli) and hyperalgesia (painful
    stimuli perceived as more painful)

Pharmacologic Therapy

Acetaminophen: 650mg q6hr or 1g q8h. \<3g/day. (\<2g in liver patients)

- Avoid if you are worried about masking fevers

NSAIDs: A great option for acute pain, especially musculoskeletal, HA,
and nephrolithiasis in eligible patients (ex: IV/po ketorolac,
ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.)

- Avoid in acute or chronic kidney disease and ↑ risk of bleeding.
    Caution in CAD/PVD

Topical Analgesics: Best for localized pain but utilized frequently as
part of a multimodal regimen

- Lidocaine ointment, patches (PADR needed at VA for patches. Can get
    by saying contraindication to TCA/gabapentinoids/SNRIs due to
    sedation risk)

- Menthol salicylate gel

- Diclofenac Gel

- Capsaicin gel

- Morphine gel (typically limited to oncology patients with tumor
    breakdown through skin)

Neuropathic Agents: Best for neuropathic pain but can be tried for other
chronic pain or as part of acute pain regimen. SNRIs and TCAs can
provide additional benefit if a pt has comorbid depression, anxiety, or
insomnia (TCA). Most agents take 6-8 weeks for peak effect.

- Gabapentin (Initial: 100 to 300 mg 1 to 3 times daily). Can be used
    for acute pain

- Pregabalin (Initial: 25 to 150 mg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses). Has
    better bioavailability. May work in patients who did not tolerate or
    did not have success with gabapentin

- Duloxetine (Initial: 30 mg daily for 1 to 2 weeks, then increase to
    60 mg daily as tolerated)

- Amitriptyline (Initial: 10 to 25 mg once daily at bedtime)

Muscle Relaxants: Should be used temporarily and intermittently but some
benefit from longer term use. Great for paraplegia, spinal injury,
spasticity.

- Methocarbamol (Initial: 1.5 g 3 to 4 times daily for 2 to 3 days
    then decrease dose to ≤4.5 g/day in 3 to 4 divided doses). Preferred
    initial agent as has least SE.

- Tizanidine (Initial: 2 to 4 mg every 6 to 12 hours as needed and/or
    at bedtime) – important to watch out for withdrawal in patients that
    take frequently at home.

- Cyclobenzaprine (Initial: 5 to 10 mg once daily before bedtime)

- Metaxalone (Oral: 800 mg 3 to 4 times daily)

Opioids: Frequently used in hospital for acute pain. Limit use as much
as possible in chronic pain as contributes to long-term central
sensitization. May benefit some patient populations but should always be
used as a component of a comprehensive, multimodal, patient-specific
treatment plan.

- Refer to section under Opioids: General Principles & Conversions for
    OME equivalents

<!-- -->

- If \>80 OME per day, ensure patient is prescribed naloxone

- If \>120 OME per day, refer to pain clinic

<!-- -->

- Common choices for acute pain in hospital (always start at low end
    for opioid naïve):

<!-- -->

- Oxycodone (PO) 5-10mg q4 to 6 hours prn

- Hydromorphone (IV) 0.25 to 1mg q2 to 3 hours prn

<!-- -->

- For pts on opioids at home, should always continue in hospital to
    avoid withdrawal unless clinically contraindicated. Can always
    titrate dose as needed

- Tramadol: Has opioid & NSAID properties. Of note, tramadol also
    inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Metabolized by
    CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 so there is variability between patients. Typical
    dose: 25 to 50mg q4 to 6 hours prn

NMDA Antagonists: Usually prescribed by our pain management colleagues
but worthwhile to think about as a potential option if a patient’s pain
continues to be difficult to control.

- Ketamine (IV infusion). SE includes AMS/delirium, hallucinations,
    and dissociation.

- Memantine (PO)

Alpha 2 agonists (central pain): Not commonly utilized in everyday
practice, but helpful in certain patients with chronic pain (off-label).
Guanfacine vs clonidine

Non-pharmacologic therapies

Procedural Intervention: Best utilized when there is a specific,
targetable

- Referral to chronic/interventional pain management (Nerve blocks or
    Radio-ablative therapy)

Adjunct Therapies: Patient’s will have varying opinions and responses on
adjunctive therapies, but these can be as important as any pharmacologic
therapy. CBT, personalized exercise regimen, PT/OT, chiropractor,
acupuncture

Additional Resources for Residents

- Pain Management Center at VUMC

- Pain Clinic at the VA. Would specify whether or not you are OK with
    them initiating opioids.

- Complementary and Integrative Health consult at VA

- Osher Center for Integrative Health at Vanderbilt

Acute pain for special populations

Renal dysfunction: Check that meds are renally dosed and start with
non-sedating options. Always avoid NSAIDs, morphine and codeine.

- Acetaminophen and topicals

- Opioids: oxycodone 2.5 to 5 mg, IV hydromorphone 0.25-0.5mg,
    fentanyl IV 25 to 50mcg

- Gabapentin: start with spot 100mg. Be extremely careful with quick
    up titration in CKD due to sedation risk.

- Methocarbamol: no specific renal dosing, try 500-750mg initially

Cirrhosis: Always avoid NSAIDs, morphine, codeine, hydromorphone (may be
OK in mild to moderate cirrhosis)

- Acetaminophen (2g max/d) & topicals are safe

- Gabapentin: start with spot 100mg

- Methocarbamol: no specific hepatic dosing, try 500 mg initially

- Other options: consider tramadol 25-50 mg vs oxycodone 2.5 mg

History of substance use disorder: Overnight, always review handoff as
day team likely has specific plan in place.

- With substance use history, typically rely on multimodal agents as
    above. Patients who are in recovery may prefer to avoid opioids
    themselves

- However, patients with OUD can and do have acute, severe pain due to
    injury, infections, procedures, etc. NEVER withhold opiates if
    clinically appropriate, regardless of substance use history

Hospice

Background

- Hospice: aims to provide aggressive palliative care for patients at
    the end of their life, usually when life-prolonging treatment
    options have stopped

<!-- -->

- Eligibility: less than or equal to 6- month life expectancy

    - Consider: palliative performance scale (PPS) rating of \<50-60%,
        dependence in 3 of 6 ADL’s, alteration in nutritional status, or
        documented deterioration in 4-6 months

- Levels of Care

    - General inpatient care: Patients must require skilled nursing
        care that could not be provided at home (IV medications,
        suction, high flow O2,) No cost to the patient under this level
        of care.

    - Home hospice-Patients are discharged to their "home”: which
        could be a long term care facility, assisted living facility, or
        their house.

- What is covered?

    - Personnel:

        - Hospice RN visits at least weekly and as needed; crisis
            on-call visits available 24/7

        - SW, Chaplain, Hospice MD oversight

        - CNAs: usually 1 hr, 2-3/wk at most

    - Medicines for comfort

    - Medical equipment for comfort and safety including oxygen

    - Up to 13 months of bereavement for caregivers after the death

    - Respite care for 5 days, usually in a nursing home

    - Inpatient hospice at hospice facility or at certain hospitals
        for symptom control for up to 7 days

- Hospice can be offered to patients without insurance

VA Specifics for Hospice:

- Main difference compared to VUMC is pt is allowed concurrent care

<!-- -->

- This means vets can continue to receive some treatments for the
    primary condition (e.g., palliative radiation or chemotherapy) and
    still receive hospice services

<!-- -->

- Additionally, all veterans that go on hospice should have any needed
    nursing home stay (at a contracted SNF) covered by the VA regardless
    of service connection

- VA Palliative Care team will help with these referrals

- One (1) F Status at the VA

<!-- -->

- Designates “treating specialty” as NA-HOSPICE. Reduces costs for
    families, helps quality metrics. Use this if patient qualifies and
    agrees to hospice care

- Write Delayed Transfer Orders: Admit to NA-HOSPICE and Specialty as
    “Hospice for Acute Care”

- Write a nursing text order to “Change Patient to 1-F Status”

Medications for Imminently Dying Patients

General recommendations

- At VUMC, there is a very helpful order set titled “Comfort Care
    Orders (Trauma, MICU, SICU, NEURO ICU, Palliative Care”

- Make sure to remove unnecessary medications, labs, telemetry,
    nursing text orders, etc.

Pain

- Morphine 2mg IV or SQ q1h PRN (avoid if renal failure)

- Hydromorphone 0.25 – 0.5mg IV or SQ q1h PRN

- Write as PRN, as needed for pain \> 2/10 or for air hunger

- If ineffective after 1 hours, increase by 50-100%

- If given every hour for 3-4 hours, consider an infusion (given PRN
    dose as hourly rate)

- Fentanyl is not a great option in ICU unless it is a continuous
    drip. Bolus lasts only 15 mins

Dyspnea/Tachypnea

- Assess for volume overload, considering decrease or stopping IVFs or
    tube feeds

- Opioids are the treatment of choice for dyspnea

- Consider Benzodiazepines for air hunger not controlled by opiates

- Supplemental oxygen for comfort (do not base on O2 sat). Consider
    use of cool air or fan

Restlessness/agitation/anxiety

- Assess for urinary retention, constipation, pain, other modifiable
    factors

- Lorazepam (Ativan) 0.5 – 1 mg PO or IV q4h PRN (tablet can be made
    into slurry if patient is experiencing dysphagia)

Nausea

- Ondansetron (Zofran) 4mg IV q4h or 8mg q8h PRN

- Promethazine (Phenergan) 25mg PO or PR q6h PRN; caution can be very
    sedating

- Prochlorperazine (Compazine) 10mg PO or IV q4h PRN

- Haloperidol (Haldol)

- If felt to be obstructive in etiology, try Dexamethasone 4mg IV or
    SQ q8-12h with Octreotide 100-400mcg IV or SQ q8h

- If felt to be related to anxiety, try Lorazepam; see dosing above

- Scopolamine is highly anti-cholinergic and takes time to be
    effective, so would NOT use in imminently dying patients

Secretions

- Remember: the patient is NOT bothered by their own secretions, and
    it is often the family and caregivers who are likely disturbed, so
    avoid deep suctioning

- Glycopyrrolate (Robinul) 0.2 – 0.4 mg SQ or IV q6h PRN

- Atropine 1% Ophthalmic Solution 2 drops sublingual 2-4h PRN

Video Examples for Navigating Difficult Conversations – Mohana Karlekar

Navigating difficult conversations with patients can be daunting
especially if you have never seen someone do one well before.
Conversations should follow a logical and sequential approach. much like
any procedure we perform in medicine. Like all procedures, practice
makes us better

Here are some suggestions for “Navigating Difficult Conversations”

- Step 1. Determine your message-keep it simple and short

- Step 2. Identify what type of news you are communicating: breaking
    bad news, assessing understanding of information, communicating
    prognosis, or navigating goals of care

- Step 3. Pick the video that best suits your purpose

The Death Pronouncement – Michael J. Neuss

This scenario arises in a variety of contexts, including the units,
wards, and cross-cover. You might know the patient and family well, but
particularly when cross covering, that may not be the case

- This approach to the death pronouncement is based in part on the
    AAFP’s “Death Pronouncement: Survival Tips for Residents” (Am Fam
    Physician. 1998 Jul 1;58(1):284-285.)

Before Entering:

- Familiarize yourself with the most important points of the patient’s
    hospitalization and recent events. Be aware of the circumstances of
    the patient’s death, particularly whether death was expected or
    sudden.

- Inquire as to which family is present including whether the POA is
    currently at bedside

- In general, it is best to enter accompanied, ideally with the
    patient’s nurse. It is rare for the chaplain to be present but that
    might also be a consideration.

In The Room:

- Especially when cross-covering, make sure to introduce yourself to
    family, and allow them time to introduce themselves to you

- Less is more when it comes to what you say: it can be good to be
    empathetic (consider only short statements such as “I am sorry for
    your loss”) but focus mainly on the task at hand, allowing time for
    families to be present with their loved one

- Explain that you have been called to examine the patient to confirm
    that they have passed. Allow a brief time for questions; it is rare
    (but not impossible) that someone may wish to excuse themselves for
    the pronouncement

- Note the location of a working clock when you enter; your watch is
    ok too but do make sure to avoid looking at your smartphone to check
    the time of death

The Exam and Pronouncement

- Identify the patient by wrist band

- Confirm that the patient does not respond to stimuli; one discreet
    way to confirm a lack of response to tactile stimuli is to hold the
    hand, and apply pressure to a nailbed, appearing to hold the hand
    while looking at/visually inspecting the face or other part of the
    body

- Confirm the absence of spontaneous respirations and absence of heart
    sounds. Listen for a full minute as some patients have extended
    periods of apnea

- Examine the pupils and note the absence of pupillary light reflex

- Note the time at which your examination is completed. This is the
    time of death

- Make sure to ask if the family would like an autopsy to be
    performed. This is often overlooked, and as awkward as it might feel
    to ask for this, it is a requirement

- Make sure you have notified the attending of record

\*Please see further VA- and VUMC-specific guidance below

Death Process at VUMC

- The key thing is to ensure that all components are completed in the
    “Discharge as Deceased” tab under the Transfer-Discharge screen

- EACH AND EVERY component of this tab must be completed before
    Decedent Affairs will accept the body

Required steps:

- Cardiopulmonary Death Charting -\> Select “New Reading” and
    complete.

- Cardiopulmonary Death -\>Select “+Create Note”

- Medical Examiner Criteria -\> Select “+New Reading”; Criteria
    requiring notification of ME is listed in a drop down menu in the
    navigator. Includes accidental deaths, threats to public health,
    suspicion for foul play, etc. The Vanderbilt Operator can assist
    with connecting you to the ME; alternatively, you can call
    615-743-1800 during business hours (M-F 8am – 4:30pm) or the
    after-hours pager at 800-216-0107.

<!-- -->

- All patients diagnosed with Covid are automatic ME cases

<!-- -->

- Autopsy Criteria -\> Select “+New Reading”

- Preliminary Cause of Death and Date/Time of Death -\>. Rather than
    list “Cardiopulmonary arrest,” be specific (e.g., Pulmonary
    Embolism, Myocardial Infarction, Metastatic Colon Cancer, etc.)

- Deceased’s Info – Report of Death

<!-- -->

- If you need to leave this and return later after collecting
    information, you can access your partially complete entries by
    clicking on the date/time text that appears under the ribbon. This
    is not intuitive because the numbers listing the date/time do not at
    all appear as though they act like a hyperlink (but they do).

- Be specific; TDS will want you to have listed the name of the family
    you notified, the TDS Case Number (which the RN typically enters),
    and your attending physician’s name (to sign the death certificate;
    give their pager number in this subsection).

<!-- -->

- Report of Death Note -\> Select “+New Reading” and complete.

- Complete Synopsis + Hospital Course and then at the very bottom
    under Summary of Death select “+Create Note.”

- Once all of this paperwork is finished, be sure to touch base with
    the patient’s nurse, usually contact Decedent Affairs and assist in
    making sure the body is moved
