Rehabilitation Options – Evan Berlin, Scott Miller, Adam Epps, Lauren
Massey

**Physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R)** physicians focus on
restoring function and quality of life to those with physical
impairments or disabilities affecting the brain, spinal cord, nerves,
bones, joints, ligaments, muscles, and tendons

**Physiatrists** specialize in determining appropriate rehab options for
hospitalized patients

Acute Inpatient Rehabilitation (IPR) or Inpatient Rehabilitation
facility (IRF):

- IPR involves a multidisciplinary team of physicians, physical
    therapists, occupational therapists, speech and language
    pathologists

- Pts admitted to IPR must be able to tolerate a minimum of 3 hours of
    rehab per day for 5 days a week

- Pts must have medical complexity warranting medical supervision by a
    physician

- Physicians are required to evaluate admitted patients at least 3
    times a week

- Average length of stay (LOS) in acute inpatient rehab is 10-12 days

Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF):

- Patients admitted to SNF require skilled needs: Wound care, IV
    therapy, Catheter care, PT, OT, and/or SLP

- There are no minimal requirements for daily therapy, but patients
    may receive up to 1.5 hours/day, depending on availability at the
    facility (in practice it is often less than this)

- Physicians are required to evaluate admitted patients at least once
    every 30 days

- Average length of stay is 26 days

Long-Term Acute Care Hospital (LTACH):

- Pts admitted to LTACH require extended hospitalization and include
    pts who will be receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation

- Pts will be recommended for transfer to an LTACH when no reasonable
    functional or medical improvement can be expected in an acute
    inpatient stay

- LTACHs can be within a hospital or may be free-standing

- Average length of stay must be greater than 25 days

Assisted Living:

- Pts receive a combination of long-term housing, personal care
    services, and health care

- Designed for individuals who need assistance with activities of
    daily living

- Can be provided in freestanding communities, near or integrated with
    SNFs, hospitals or retirement communities

Outpatient Services:

- Can be ordered at discharge with or without official PT/OT
    recommendations

- Home health (HH): wide range of healthcare services provided in
    patients home ranging from wound care to IV antibiotics

<!-- -->

- HH PT/OT: pts can receive therapy at home when unable to attend
    outpatient PT/OT

- HH nursing services: required for IV antibiotics or PICC line
    maintenance; consider for wound care, other services include
    medication adherence and reconciliation

- HH non-skilled aide: outside the scope of acute hospitalization, but
    helps with ADLs

<!-- -->

- Outpatient PT/OT: Consider for those who would benefit from therapy
    but do not meet the qualifications for other dispositions or would
    prefer outpatient therapy

PM&R Consultation – Evan Berlin, Scott Miller, Adam Epps, Lauren Massey

Reasons for Consultation/Referral to PM&R:

- If PT/OT recommends Inpatient Rehabilitation (IPR) for post-acute
    disposition

<!-- -->

- Recommended for pts with: Spinal Cord Injuries, Traumatic Brain
    Injuries, Poly-trauma, CVA, Amputation, Burns, Critical Illness
    /Acute Polyneuropathies or Myopathies, Prolonged Hospitalization

<!-- -->

- Benefits of PM&R Consults include:

<!-- -->

- Confirms and facilitates post- acute rehab disposition (SNF vs IPR
    refined opinion)

- Provides comprehensive document for insurance and post-acute
    provider resource

- Facilitates communication between PM&R consultant, primary team,
    case management, PT/OT, and post-acute rehab provider

- Provision of bedside MSK ultrasound-guided injections: joint
    injections (small and large), bursa injections, peripheral nerve
    injections (lateral femoral cutaneous, carpal tunnel, cubital
    tunnel) and diagnostic joint aspirations

- Co-management for acute or chronic spasticity, neurogenic bowel and
    bladder

- Can be helpful in identifying equipment required for discharge

    - Gait impairments of uncertain etiology impacting post- acute
        care disposition safety

    - Autonomic dysreflexia

    - Paroxysmal sympathetic hyperactivity associated with brain
        injury

    - Contracture, pressure wound insight or prevention

Spasticity – Doug Bryant and Jake Dovgan

Background

- Spasticity is a velocity-dependent increase in resistance to passive
    stretch.

- It differs from hypertonia in that hypertonia is resistance to
    passive stretch that is not velocity-dependent.

- Spasticity is believed to result from disruption of descending
    inhibitory modulation of the alpha motor neurons by an upper motor
    lesion, producing hyperexcitability.

- Grading (by the Modified Ashworth Scale)

<!-- -->

- 0=no increase in tone

- 1=slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release
    or by minimal resistance at the end of ROM when affected part is
    moved in flexion or extension

- 1+=slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch followed by
    minimal resistance through the remainder of ROM (less than half)

- 2=more marked increase in muscle tone through most of ROM, but
    affected part is easily moved.

- 3=considerable increases in muscle tone; passive movement difficult

- 4=affected part is rigid in flexion or extension

Management

- Spasticity can have functional benefits, including improving
    standing and transfers. However, it can also cause weakness, poor
    dexterity, pain, and contractures.

- If spasticity is having undesirable effects, first line of treatment
    is PT/OT and physical modalities such as stretching.

- Oral Medications

| Medication                | Mechanism of Action                             | Side Effects/Important Considerations                                            |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Baclofen                  | GABA-B agonist                                  | sedation, fatigue, nausea, centrally acting – risk of withdrawal                 |
| Tizanidine                | Alpha-2 agonist                                 | sedation, dizziness, xerostomia, weakness, centrally acting – risk of withdrawal |
| Diazepam/ Benzodiazepines | GABA-A agonist                                  | sedation, confusion, hypotension, centrally acting – risk of withdrawal          |
| Dantrolene                | inhibits Ca release from sarcoplasmic reticulum | weakness, sedation, nausea, hepatotoxicity, acts directly on skeletal muscle     |

- Intrathecal baclofen: Reserved for patients who have significant
    side effects with oral anti-spasticity medications or who have
    severe, persistent, and diffuse spasticity despite maximal doses.

- Injections

<!-- -->

- Botulinum toxin: Blocks the presynaptic release of acetylcholine
    from motor endplates of the lower motor neuron at the myoneural
    junction. Effect usually lasts 3-8months

- Alcohol block: Phenol and ethanol are neurolytic agents that can be
    used to block nerves with motor function.

<!-- -->

- Surgeries

<!-- -->

- Selective dorsal rhizotomy, osteotomy, muscle tendon lengthening,
    release, or transfer

\*\*\*If a patient experiences worsening of spasticity, it is important
to consider other underlying conditions such as infections, pressure
ulcers, constipation, or bladder distention\*\*\*

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) – Jake Dovgan and Doug Bryant

Background

- TBI is categorized as a disruption in brain function leading to
    decreased consciousness, memory deficits, neurological deficits, or
    intracranial lesion.

- This disruption is a result of an external blow or force.

- Most common causes of TBI are falls and MVC.

- Falls are the most common cause of TBI in elderly population.

Assessment

- Mechanism of injury

- Initial GCS

- Loss of consciousness and duration

- Other injuries

- Initial evaluation should include a non-contrasted head CT to rule
    out hemorrhage

- Full neuro exam including but not limited to cranial nerves,
    strength, cognition (orientation), memory, reflexes, sensation,
    cerebellar testing, range of motion of joints, Babinski, and
    Hoffmann's

Classification

| Severity | GCS   | Post-Traumatic Amnesia | Loss of Consciousness       |
|----------|-------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Mild     | 13-15 | \<1 day                | \<30 minutes                |
| Moderate | 9-12  | 1 day to 7 days        | \>30 minutes and \<24 hours |
| Severe   | 3-8   | \>1 week               | \> 24 hours                 |

Evaluation and Management

- Secondary complications following TBI:

<!-- -->

- In the acute setting, patients who have had a TBI are at risk for
    seizures, agitation, autonomic problems, bowel/bladder, wounds,
    vertigo, headaches, and cognitive impairment, venous thrombosis, and
    spasticity

<!-- -->

- If concerned about TBI would consult PM&R and Speech Therapy for
    assistance in management of complications and assessment of
    cognition.

- If concerned for spasticity refer to “Spasticity section” for
    specific medication recommendations.

Musculoskeletal (MSK) Injuries

Shoulder Pain – Joseph Nowatzke

Background

- Bones: Clavicle, Scapula (Acromion and Coracoid process) and
    Proximal Humerus  

- Rotator Cuff: Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres minor,
    subscapularis

- Neurovascular: anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries,
    branching off axillary artery; Innervated by axillary,
    suprascapular, subscapular nerve off brachial plexus  

- Labrum is a cup-shaped rim of cartilage lining and reinforces the
    shoulder joint by surrounding the glenoid fossa, allowing extra
    support to the head of the humerus

Presentation

- Brachial Plexus Palsies 

- Vascular Pathology (e.g. thoracic outlet syndrome, thrombus,
    atherosclerosis, vasculitis) 

<!-- -->

- Typical symptoms are tightness, heaviness, cramping, or weakness
    in arm 

<!-- -->

- Rotator Cuff Injuries:  

<!-- -->

- Impingement Syndrome: supraspinatus is most susceptible

- Tendinopathy: develops after repetitive motions; pain worsens with
    active movement

- Tendon Tear: develop as a progression of tendinopathy; develops
    weakness

<!-- -->

- Labral Tear & SLAP (superior labral tear from anterior to
    posterior): develop in repetitive overhead motions (swimming,
    baseball, tennis); often described as a “catching” sensation 

- Adhesive capsulitis: “frozen shoulder” stiffened glenohumeral joint,
    loss of both active and passive RoM. Increased frequency in
    diabetics 

- AC (acromioclavicular) joint pain: joint often affected by OA, RA
    and common cause for anterior shoulder pain shoulder separations
    and osteoarthritis  

- Glenohumeral OA: degeneration of articular cartilage and subchondral
    bone with narrowing of the glenohumeral joint. Presents in older
    adults with progressively worsening anterior shoulder pain and
    stiffness in both passive and active ROM

- Biceps Tendinopathy: localized anterior shoulder pain, worsened with
    overhead lifting; when rupture develops, will often have a “lump”
    and acute worsening of symptoms 

- Posterior shoulder pain often related to cervical radiculopathy 

Evaluation

- Physical Exam: 

<!-- -->

- Inspection: Symmetry, erythema, ecchymosis, swelling, deformity,
    muscle atrophy (deltoid, infraspinatus), scapular winging 

- Palpation: warmth, landmarks, tenderness: SC joint, clavicle, AC
    joint, acromion, spine of scapula, bicipital groove, biceps tendon,
    greater tuberosity of humerus, common myofascial trigger points
    (trapezius, levator scapulae, rhomboids, supraspinatus) 

- Passive ROM: performed by the examiner without patient assistance

    - Helps to distinguish motion limitations caused by a structural
        constraint (adhesive capsulitis) vs. motion limitations caused
        by pain 

- Active ROM: performed by the pt on their own. Loss of active motion
    usually indicates weakness due to either muscular (tears) or nerve
    injury 

- C-spine: evaluate the C-spine as the origin of pain that may be
    referred to the shoulder 

- Provocation tests: see Below

<!-- -->

- Imaging:  

<!-- -->

- Not as useful as a thorough physical exam, especially if
    non-traumatic pain 

- XR: AP (Internal Rotation, External Rotation), Lateral, Scapular and
    axillary views 

- CT: often reserved for traumatic fracture and artificial joint
    assessment 

- MRI w/out contrast: used to evaluate soft tissues, tendons, muscle
    and bursae

- Ultrasound: becoming more useful for initial evaluation of rotator
    cuff

Management

- Fractures: require assessment by orthopedics for reduction and
    surgical intervention

- Soft Tissue Injuries, Arthritis 

<!-- -->

- Conservative management: referral to PT for muscle strengthening,
    flexibility, and postural improvement.  

- Consider short course of NSAIDs, 7-10 days (meloxicam, diclofenac)
    for pain relief

- Injections can often be diagnostic and therapeutic – refer to ortho 

- Sports Medicine referral for surgical evaluation if pt fails
    conservative therapy

Neck Pain – Samir Khan

Background

- Most common cause of neck pain in adults: degenerative changes of
    the cervical spine

- Most atraumatic neck pain does not require imaging

Presentation

- Cervical muscle strain:  pain + stiffness with movement 2/2 muscular
    injury

- Degenerative disc disease/osteoarthritis: pain + stiffness with
    movement from derangement in disc architecture leads to inability to
    distribute pressure in the joint

- Cervical radiculopathy: neuropathic pain, sensory abnormalities,
    and/or weakness in an upper extremity (often radiating to hand)

- Cervical myelopathy: spinal cord compression causing neurologic
    dysfunction

<!-- -->

- Earliest symptom is gait disturbance. Pain is uncommon

<!-- -->

- Non-cervical conditions: shoulder pathology, migraine/headaches,
    occipital neuralgia, torticollis, thoracic outlet syndrome, angina
    pectoris/MI, bony metastases, vertebral artery or carotid artery
    dissection, fibromyalgia, meningitis, transverse myelitis 

- Posterior neck pain 

<!-- -->

- Axial only à MSK (sprain vs degenerative disc disease) 

- Axial + Extremity Pain  Radiculopathy 

<!-- -->

- Anterior neck pain 

<!-- -->

- Common sources: esophageal, thyroiditis, carotidynia, lymphadenitis,
    Ludwig’s angina

- Red flags: recent trauma, lower extremity weakness, gait
    abnormality, bowel/bladder incontinence, fever, weight loss 

Evaluation

- Determine MSK (axial pain) vs Radiculopathy/Myelopathy vs
    Non-spinal

- Imaging indications: Neuro deficits, Red flags, persistent
    pain (\> 6 weeks) 

<!-- -->

- Cervical Plain films, 2-view (AP and lateral) 

- Cervical MRI: visualizes spinal cord, nerve roots, bone marrow,
    discs and soft tissues

    - Usually w/o contrast; can consider contrast if malignancy or
        infection suspected

<!-- -->

- EMG/Nerve Conduction Studies: not routinely used for neck pain
    evaluation, but can be used to distinguish cervical radicular pain
    from peripheral causes of extremity dysesthesia

Management

- Cervical strain, Cervical radiculopathy: PT

<!-- -->

- 5 d course of oral prednisone 60-80 mg, followed by 7-14 day taper

- Anti-spasmodic prn: Flexeril or Robaxin

- If not improving or progressive symptoms refer to Ortho Spine + PM&R

<!-- -->

- Cervical myelopathy requires urgent surgical evaluation  

Acute Back Pain – Christian Roehmer

Background

- \>90% of back pain is nonspecific and musculoskeletal in nature

- Can’t Miss: Spinal cord compression, cauda equina, cancer, spinal
    abscess, discitis, or osteomyelitis

- Extra-axial causes: Pancreatitis, nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis,
    AAA, zoster

Presentation

- Lumbar strain: diffuse pain in lumbar muscles, may radiate 

- Degenerative disk or facet process: localized lumbar pain, similar
    to lumbar strain 

- Inflammatory arthritis: morning stiffness, improves with movement,
    systemic symptoms 

- Osteoarthritis: pain with use, improves with rest 

- Herniated disk: radiating pain to legs, often below the knees 

- Compression fracture: older patients, trauma, spine tenderness on
    exam 

- Spinal stenosis: pain improves with flexion, shopping cart sign 

- Spondylolysis: pain with extension 

- Spondylolisthesis: pain with activity, improves with rest, can be
    seen with imaging 

- Scoliosis: abnormal spine curvature, seen on physical exam
    inspection 

Evaluation

- Physical Exam: 

<!-- -->

- Inspection: Should include posture, Adam’s Forward Bend Test
    (screens for scoliosis), and limb length discrepancy à kyphosis,
    lordosis, or scoliosis 

- Palpation/Percussion: Sensitive for identifying spinal infection,
    metastases, or compression fractures

    - Spinous processes, lumbar “step-offs,” paravertebral muscles and
        SI joint

- Range of Motion: Pain with extension and relieved by flexion
    suggests spinal stenosis  

- Neurologic Examination:

    - L2: hip flexion; L3: knee extension; L4: dorsiflexion; L5: great
        toe flexion 

    - S1: plantarflexion 

- Waddell’s Signs:  Raise suspicion of non-organic pain  

    - Superficial tenderness, pain that improves with
        distraction (attention diverted)

    - Pain with sham maneuvers (simulation)

    - Overreaction (disproportionate psychomotor responses)

    - Non-physiologic neurologic deficits

<!-- -->

- ESR/CRP: Can be used if concern for infection or malignancy

Imaging

- X-ray: b/l AP, unilateral, lateral, b/l sunrise view

- Obtain X-rays in standing position (or joint space narrowing may not
    be apparent) 

- MSK U/S: allows for dynamic imaging and is ≈100% sensitive
    for effusion 

- Also visualizes ligaments, muscles/tendons, joint space,
    and vasculature 

- MRI:  indicated after failure of conservative management or when
    considering surgical repair 

Treatment: 

- RICE (rest, ice, compression, elevation) for acute injuries 

- Bracing 

- NSAIDs: see prior section for anti-inflammatory dosing

- PT for 4-6 weeks for ligamentous, muscular, or meniscal injury  

- Antibiotics may be appropriate for bursitis if infection
    is suspected 

- Referral to orthopedics/sports medicine if no improvement after
    conservative therapy
