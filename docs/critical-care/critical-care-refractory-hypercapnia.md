# Refractory Hypercapnia

## Background
-	Inadequate clearance of CO2 leading to respiratory acidosis (pH ≤ 7.20) despite maximum RR&TV (i.e. minute ventilation) tolerated without causing barotrauma or autoPEEP
-	Common causes:
    -	Obstructive lung disease (COPD, emphysema, asthma)
    -	Hypoventilation (sleep apnea, obesity, sedative medications (i.e. opiates), neuromuscular weakness, chest wall trauma, ascites/pleural effusion)
    -	Increased CO2 load (shock, sepsis, malignant hyperthermia)
-	Presentation:
    -	Shortness of breath, AMS, somnolence, hypoxemia, tachycardia, HTN (in some cases)

## Evaluation 
-	Physical exam, mental status, recent medications
-	ABG or VBG – if increased PCO2 and normal pH, always treat the pH and not the PCO2 (i.e., may be compensated chronic hypercarbia and blowing off more CO2 may be harmful)

## Management Algorithm
-	Special considerations
    -	If history of OSA, make sure they are on home CPAP/BiPAP
    -	If opiate related, trial Narcan
    -	Bronchodilators for reactive airway diseases
-	 BiPAP
     -	 Contraindicated if pt unable to remove BiPAP mask on their own
     -	 Increase MV by increasing Δ between IPAP/EPAP or increasing RR
-	Mechanical ventilation
    -	Allows you to control rate and TV (in VC modes)
    -	To increase MV and CO2 clearance:
        -	Increase RR
            -	30-35 breaths/min is about as high as you can go
            -	Need to keep in mind I/E time to avoid breath stacking/autoPEEP
            -	Some signs of autoPEEP include worsening hypotension and the expiratory limb on the flow waveform on the vent not returning to zero
        -	Increase TV -> we usually start at 4-6mL/kg PBW. You can consider increasing to 8mL/kg PBW as long as plateau pressures remain < 30 cm H2O
            -	Goal peak pressures ≤ 35 cmH2O / plateau pressures ≤ 30 cmH2O
    -	ARDS -> permissive hypercapnia (goal pH ≥ 7.2)
-	V-V ECMO / Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R)
    -	 Indications for ECMO for hypercapnia:
         -	 Severe dynamic hyperinflation and/or severe respiratory acidosis
         -	 pH ≤ 7.25 with PaCO2 ≥ 60 for 6h with RR at 35/min and TV increased to target maximum MV while keeping plateau pressure ≤ 32 cmH2O
    -	 Similar considerations and contraindications as refractory hypoxemia (see section)
         -	 Benefits: Reduces work of breathing, promotes early ventilator weaning/extubating  allows early mobilization and recovery
