# Introduction to Vent Management

## Ventilator Settings:
-	See above table in Modes of Oxygen Delivery for variables adjusted in each ventilator mode
-	Trigger: what initiates a breath; time, flow, or pressure (pt triggers are flow and pressure; ventilator breaths are trigged by time)

## Static Ventilator Readouts:
-	Plateau pressure (Pplat): measure with inspiratory hold, assesses static lung compliance
-	Auto-PEEP: measure with expiratory hold; occurs when volume of previous breath is not entirely expelled before the next breath is initiated
## Dynamic Ventilator Readouts:
-	Measured RR: in most modes, pt may trigger breaths above set RR; if set and measured RR match consider ↓ respiratory drive (sedation, neurologic injury) or iatrogenic over-ventilation
-	VTi / VTe: tidal volume of inspiration (VTi) and expiration (VTe)
    -	VTi should approximately equal VTe, if not then concern for air leak (e.g. cuff leak or pneumothorax) or auto-PEEP
-	Minute ventilation: calculated from VTe x RR; higher MV = more CO2 clearance
-	Peak pressure: highest pressure reached in the entire ventilator cycle

## Critical Non-ventilator hemodynamic readouts:
-	SpO2: if poor waveform or discordant with PaO2, may need serial ABG
-	HR: quickest indicator of emergencies such as pneumothorax, PE, ventilator disconnection
-	Blood pressure: positive pressure ventilation decreases preload and afterload; depending on the underlying pt physiology, increases in positive pressure may be detrimental or beneficial for BP

        <p>Step 1: Check plateau pressure by performing inspiratory hold. Must be in VC mode.</p>
        <p>High Peak and Low Plateau = Dynamic compliance issue -> High Resistance</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Check circuit tubing for excess water condensation or a kink. Ask RT to disconnect and clear circuit</li>
          <li>Check if pt is biting ETT</li>
          <li>Incline suction to clear secretions or proximal mucous plug</li>
          <li>Auscultate for wheezing/stridor to indicate bronchospasm or airway obstruction->give bronchodilators</li>
        </ul>
        <p>High Peak and High Plateau = Static compliance issue -> Worsening alveolar process</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Emergencies to quickly assess for:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Tension PTX</li>
            <li>Main stem intubation (ask about any tube migration, listen to breath sounds, CXR)</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Consider worsening alveolar process leading to decreased lung compliance: worsening pulmonary edema, PNA, DAH, ARDS or other non-alveolar process such as new pleural effusion, obesity, intraabdominal compartment syndrome</li>
          <ul>
            <li>CXR, b-lines, tracheal aspirate, bronch, etc</li>
            <li>Treat according to etiology (chest tube, reposition ETT, diuresis, abx, etc)</li>

      <td>Pt is not getting the desired tidal volume/VE that was set in the vent parameters. The alarm reports exhaled VE. May cause inadequate ventilation, CO2 retention, potentially hypoxia</td>
      <td>
        <p>Compare inspiratory tidal volumes (Vti) with expiratory tidal volumes (Vte) on the ventilator. If Vti>Vte, check for a leak in the system</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Have RT check all connections</li>
          <li>Listen for a cuff leak – can have RT check a cuff pressure and if low then re-inflate->sometimes need to do an ETT exchange</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Pt may need more support, ie switching to a different vent mode (PS to PRVC). Discuss with RT or fellow</li>

        <p>If low RR and no leak and Vt at goal</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pt may be oversedated</li>
          <li>Ensure pt has a back-up rate in case they aren’t triggering the vent->may need to switch vent modes for this (i.e. take off pressure support) or increase set/ventilator respiratory rate</li>

        <p>***Check that pt hasn’t self-extubated, trach hasn’t fallen out, or been unhooked from vent***</p>
        <p>If self-extubated or tracheostomy decannulated, then immediately start bagging the pt (may need to bag from trach stoma if s/p laryngectomy). Have nurse call staff assist for re-intubation if necessary or have trach team called to replace a fresh (<7 days old) trach</p>
