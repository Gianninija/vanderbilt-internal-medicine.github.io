# Definition of Shock

Jonathan Napper

---

"Shock is the clinical expression of circulatory failure that results in inadequate cellular oxygen utilization." - Jean-Louis Vincent, M.D., Ph.D., and Daniel De Backer, M.D., Ph.D.

## Subtypes (further outlined below): 
-	Distributive (septic, anaphylactic, neurogenic, and rarely adrenal)
-	Cardiogenic (cardiomyopathies, arrhythmias, severe valvular diseases) 
-	Hypovolemic (bleeding, volume deplete states)
-	Obstructive (PE, tension PTX, cardiac tamponade, restrictive cardiomyopathies, constrictive pericarditis) 

## Signs:
-	Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or MAP < 70 mmHg, with associated tachycardia AND
-	Clinical signs of tissue hypoperfusion.
    -	Cutaneous (cold, clammy skin w/ vasoconstriction and cyanosis, evident in low-flow states)
    -	Renal (UOP of <0.5ml/kg of body weight/hr)
    -	Neurologic (AMS typically with obtundation, disorientation confusion). 
-	Hyperlactatemia (indicates abnormal cellular oxygen metabolism)
