# VA: Veterans Affairs Rotations

## VA General Wards (1A – 6B)

- Always make sure that your VA login works a few days before you are
    scheduled to start!
- Team: 1 Res, 2 Interns with soft patient cap of 8 each (16 total)
- Pagers: See VA Phone/Pager Directory Section for pager numbers
- Pick up list by 6:30 AM In the pulm/ID fellows workroom on the 2nd
    floor (between team 4 workroom and the MICU), sign-out at 6 PM
- Admitting: Teams 1-3-5 & 2-4-6 alternate admitting days and admit
    until 5:30 PM
- Non-admitting teams can sign out once their work Is complete as
    early as 2PM on weekdays and 12PM on weekends
- Rounds alternate at 7 AM on admitting days, 8 AM on non-admitting
    days, meet at workrooms; night admitting team presents to attendings
    at 7 AM (depending on team)
- Work rooms:
    - Team 1 on 2N hallway, past RN station
    - Team 2 on 2N hallway, past RN station
    - Team 3 on 2N hallway, between main elevators and RN station
    - Team 4 at 2nd floor adjacent to main elevators
    - Team 5 on 3N hallway
    - Team 6 in pulm & ID fellow workroom outside MICU on 2G
- Tips: Admission days can be very busy and anything you can get done
    on the non-admitting days will make your life easier (ex: DIPNs).
    Ensure that you tag PCP on EVERY H&P so they know patient is
    admitted (right click signed H&P -\> dropdown menu -\> "identify
    additional co-signer"), make documents in OneDrive (it's
    HIPAA-compliant!) to use as your pre-rounding sheet and sign-out
    sheet and share these with your team (for days off); roll your
    pagers via Vanderbilt operator (same as at VU); ensure all orders on
    patients still in the ED are “delayed” or they will disappear once
    on the floor (ask your resident); all consults must be accompanied
    by page to the covering fellow (use Synergy for medicine
    subspecialties consult schedule, TVHS website for surgery/other),
    beware that medications disappear after 1 month of admission (your
    pharmacist can help!), beware that diets disappear when converting
    obs to inpatient, enjoy a complimentary VA square!

## VA MICU

- Team: 3 Res, 3 Interns, no specific patient cap
- Combined CCU and MICU; 7AM CCU rounds followed by 8AM MICU rounds
- Day Intern: 7 AM - 9 PM; Night Intern 8 PM - 10 AM; MICU between 2N
    and 2G (2nd floor)
- Tips: Night intern presents all of the old patients in the morning
    and signs the notes. The day intern owns the A&P of the notes by
    keeping them updated. Never hesitate to relay information to your
    resident overnight if you are concerned (wake him/her up!)

## VA Nights

- Team: 1 Res, 2 Interns, total of 10 admissions overnight
- Pager: NIGHT ADMIT RESIDENT must roll the night admitting pager
    317-0227
- Start at 7 PM, Admit until 5 AM, present new patients to teams at 7
    AM, leave by 8 AM
- Start Sunday night for interns, Wednesday night for residents; off
    day is Saturday night for interns/cross-cover resident (covered by
    clinic resident), Friday night for admitting resident (covered by
    BMT resident)
- Tips: Admissions typically bolus at the start of shift and slow
    later in the night, so worry about seeing pts, formulating plans
    with resident and putting in orders first as notes can be finished
    once it slows down, cafeteria at VU closes at 2 AM, communicate
    everything you do with your resident who is supervising a second
    intern as well, ensure all orders on pts still in the ED are
    “delayed” or they will disappear once on the floor (ask your
    resident), enjoy a complimentary VA square for breakfast!

# How to Discharge a Patient at VUMC

- Verify the correct pharmacy with the patient (Vanderbilt MCE
    pharmacy if using meds-to-beds) and if refills of existing
    medications are needed
- Select ‘Transfer-Discharge’ on the navigator panel on eStar select
    ‘Discharge’ tab on the top of the page
- Select ‘Rx Routing’ on the left panel. Choose one of the three
    options. This choice will set the default prescribing choice for new
    medications at discharge or refilled medications. This can be
    changed manually within each Rx order
- Default = will e-prescribe to pt’s pharmacy
- Print = will print all Rx’s and not e-prescribe (printed to nursing
    station on pt’s floor)
- Do not print and do not e-prescribe (This is used for pt going to
    SNF or IPR)
- Select ‘Discharge Orders’ on the left panel. This will open a
    reconciliation navigator
- Reconcile the home medications with the current inpatient
    medications. The red tab on the right side of the screen will become
    green when all medications are addressed
- For new medications or refills, make sure the ‘Class’ in the
    prescription is set to ‘Normal’ for electronic prescriptions.
    Otherwise, to add the medication to the list without a prescription,
    choose ‘No Print’
- The medications will e-prescribe to the pharmacy selected at the
    bottom of the order panel on the right side of your screen
- To send to multiple pharmacies, select the primary pharmacy at the
    bottom of the order panel on the right side of your screen, then
    choose ‘Send to Multiple Pharmacies’
- Note that meds-to-beds will arrange to deliver meds AFTER the
    "discharge" order is signed; if discharge is time-sensitive, can
    call to ask if meds can be delivered in advance
- Next, select ‘Order Sets’ at the top of the Discharge Orders panel
- In the order box on the right, type “Adult General Discharge”
- Right-click on the option and select “Add to Favorites”. Now, this
    option will be available on the Order Set page for future patients.
- Open Adult General Discharge order set
    - Select the appropriate choices pertinent to current pt
        - For SNF/LTC, include RN orders like diet, activity
            order/restriction, wound care, etc.
    - On the right side of the screen, you can add Ad Hoc orders such
        as:
        - Hospital Follow-up with "X" service (place these as soon as
            you know!)
        - Ambulatory Referrals
        - Post-discharge labs
        - Important for ID labs in addition to INR checks, place fax
            number for which provider that will be following up results
            in the comments section. If labs will be done outside of
            Vanderbilt system, must select "External Non-VMG"
        - Medications not listed on reconciliation list
- When all sections are completed, click ‘Sign – Print and/or
    E-prescribe Now’
- Select ‘Follow-up Providers’ on the left panel.
- Select the providers that you want to receive the discharge summary.
    Provide personal instructions to the patient

- Free-text your personal comments and instructions to the patient,
    such as:
    - A simple statement for why the pt was admitted
    - Changes made to pt’s medications that you feel are important to
        highlight
    - Home instructions (daily weights, diet changes, wound care, etc)
    - Key follow-up plans (main appointments, labs, or tests)

# How to Discharge a Patient at VA

Complete the following steps in this order to ensure info will be
accurately reflected on the DIPN.

- Medication reconciliation
    - The list of outpatient medications at the end of your reconciliation
        is the final medication discharge list.
    - In the medication tab, transfer new inpatient medications to the
        outpatient medication list by right-clicking and select ‘Transfer’
    - Select “Pick up at window,” as this will ensure the patient will
        have the medication prior to leaving the hospital
    - Order new supplies (wound care, tube feeds, etc) by placing new
        outpatient "med" order
    - Review the existing outpatient medications to determine if they need
        to be continued and if the pt has an adequate supply at home -
        refill meds if necessary
    - Discontinue any outpatient medications that you do not want the pt
        to continue taking. Right-click and select ‘Discontinue’
- Return to clinic (Primary care)
- Critical to tag PCP on discharge summary to ensure they are alerted
    to hospital stay. Can also tag consultants and office coordinators
    (RNs) can be cc’d to DC summary by resident
- For PCP follow-up, no longer need to place an RTC, will be
    coordinated by PACT on the clinic side
- Ask VA Inpatient Chief for "welcome to VA wards" info with
    instructions to place subspecialty hospital follow up appts, as
    there is variation (page fellow vs e-consult vs RTC)
- Complete DIPN
    - The DIPN contains all of the discharge instructions
    - Start a new note and select ‘DIPN’ template. This will open a
        pre-templated note - follow the prompts and select finish. All
        sections need to be addressed to proceed.
    - Discharge related orders will generate after you finish the DIPN
        prompts, which includes vaccinations, removing IV, removing Foley
        catheter, etc.
    - The DIPN is valid for 24 hrs; thus the DIPN may be pre-signed one
        day prior. If DIPN is pre-signed, final changes to pt instructions
        and medications need to be addended.
    - \[Optional but strongly recommended\] Provide personal instructions
        to the patient at the top of the DIPN (coach your interns to do
        this!), such as:
        - A simple statement for why the pt was admitted
        - Changes made to pt’s medications that you feel are important to
            highlight
        - Home instructions (daily weights, diet changes, wound care, etc)
        - Key follow-up plans (main appointments, labs, or tests)
- Sign the DFF (discharge from facility) order
    - The DFF order is found under the “Discharge Orders” tab in CPRS
        orders
    - Once all steps are completed, DFF can be signed and pt will be
        discharged from facility
- Discharge summary: right click dropdown menu "identify additional
    cosigner" ALWAYS add the patient's PCP, may add other consultants or
    subspecialists for continuity
