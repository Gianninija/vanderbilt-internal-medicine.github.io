    HIPAA-compliant!) to use as your pre-rounding sheet and sign-out
    sheet and share these with your team (for days off); roll your
    pagers via Vanderbilt operator (same as at VU); ensure all orders on
    patients still in the ED are “delayed” or they will disappear once
    on the floor (ask your resident); all consults must be accompanied
    by page to the covering fellow (use Synergy for medicine
    subspecialties consult schedule, TVHS website for surgery/other),

# How to Discharge a Patient at VA

Complete the following steps in this order to ensure info will be
accurately reflected on the DIPN.

- Medication reconciliation
    - The list of outpatient medications at the end of your reconciliation
        is the final medication discharge list.
    - In the medication tab, transfer new inpatient medications to the
        outpatient medication list by right-clicking and select ‘Transfer’
    - Select “Pick up at window,” as this will ensure the patient will
        have the medication prior to leaving the hospital
    - Order new supplies (wound care, tube feeds, etc) by placing new
        outpatient "med" order
    - Review the existing outpatient medications to determine if they need
        to be continued and if the pt has an adequate supply at home -
        refill meds if necessary
    - Discontinue any outpatient medications that you do not want the pt
        to continue taking. Right-click and select ‘Discontinue’
- Return to clinic (Primary care)
- Critical to tag PCP on discharge summary to ensure they are alerted
    to hospital stay. Can also tag consultants and office coordinators
    (RNs) can be cc’d to DC summary by resident
- For PCP follow-up, no longer need to place an RTC, will be
    coordinated by PACT on the clinic side
- Ask VA Inpatient Chief for "welcome to VA wards" info with
    instructions to place subspecialty hospital follow up appts, as
    there is variation (page fellow vs e-consult vs RTC)
- Complete DIPN
    - The DIPN contains all of the discharge instructions
    - Start a new note and select ‘DIPN’ template. This will open a
        pre-templated note - follow the prompts and select finish. All
        sections need to be addressed to proceed.
    - Discharge related orders will generate after you finish the DIPN
        prompts, which includes vaccinations, removing IV, removing Foley
        catheter, etc.
    - The DIPN is valid for 24 hrs; thus the DIPN may be pre-signed one
        day prior. If DIPN is pre-signed, final changes to pt instructions
        and medications need to be addended.
    - \[Optional but strongly recommended\] Provide personal instructions
        to the patient at the top of the DIPN (coach your interns to do
        this!), such as:
        - A simple statement for why the pt was admitted
        - Changes made to pt’s medications that you feel are important to
            highlight
        - Home instructions (daily weights, diet changes, wound care, etc)
        - Key follow-up plans (main appointments, labs, or tests)
- Sign the DFF (discharge from facility) order
    - The DFF order is found under the “Discharge Orders” tab in CPRS
        orders
    - Once all steps are completed, DFF can be signed and pt will be
        discharged from facility
- Discharge summary: right click dropdown menu "identify additional
    cosigner" ALWAYS add the patient's PCP, may add other consultants or
    subspecialists for continuity
