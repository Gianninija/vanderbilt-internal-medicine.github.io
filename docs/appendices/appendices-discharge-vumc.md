# How to Discharge a Patient at VUMC

- Verify the correct pharmacy with the patient (Vanderbilt MCE
    pharmacy if using meds-to-beds) and if refills of existing
    medications are needed
- Select ‘Transfer-Discharge’ on the navigator panel on eStar select
    ‘Discharge’ tab on the top of the page
- Select ‘Rx Routing’ on the left panel. Choose one of the three
    options. This choice will set the default prescribing choice for new
    medications at discharge or refilled medications. This can be
    changed manually within each Rx order
- Default = will e-prescribe to pt’s pharmacy
- Print = will print all Rx’s and not e-prescribe (printed to nursing
    station on pt’s floor)
- Do not print and do not e-prescribe (This is used for pt going to
    SNF or IPR)
- Select ‘Discharge Orders’ on the left panel. This will open a
    reconciliation navigator
- Reconcile the home medications with the current inpatient
    medications. The red tab on the right side of the screen will become
    green when all medications are addressed
- For new medications or refills, make sure the ‘Class’ in the
    prescription is set to ‘Normal’ for electronic prescriptions.
    Otherwise, to add the medication to the list without a prescription,
    choose ‘No Print’
- The medications will e-prescribe to the pharmacy selected at the
    bottom of the order panel on the right side of your screen
- To send to multiple pharmacies, select the primary pharmacy at the
    bottom of the order panel on the right side of your screen, then
    choose ‘Send to Multiple Pharmacies’
- Note that meds-to-beds will arrange to deliver meds AFTER the
    "discharge" order is signed; if discharge is time-sensitive, can
    call to ask if meds can be delivered in advance
- Next, select ‘Order Sets’ at the top of the Discharge Orders panel
- In the order box on the right, type “Adult General Discharge”
- Right-click on the option and select “Add to Favorites”. Now, this
    option will be available on the Order Set page for future patients.
- Open Adult General Discharge order set
    - Select the appropriate choices pertinent to current pt
        - For SNF/LTC, include RN orders like diet, activity
            order/restriction, wound care, etc.
    - On the right side of the screen, you can add Ad Hoc orders such
        as:
        - Hospital Follow-up with "X" service (place these as soon as
            you know!)
        - Ambulatory Referrals
        - Post-discharge labs
        - Important for ID labs in addition to INR checks, place fax
            number for which provider that will be following up results
            in the comments section. If labs will be done outside of
            Vanderbilt system, must select "External Non-VMG"
        - Medications not listed on reconciliation list

    E-prescribe Now’

        highlight
    - Home instructions (daily weights, diet changes, wound care, etc)
