# VA: Veterans Affairs Rotations

## VA General Wards (1A – 6B)

- Always make sure that your VA login works a few days before you are
    scheduled to start!
- Team: 1 Res, 2 Interns with soft patient cap of 8 each (16 total)
- Pagers: See VA Phone/Pager Directory Section for pager numbers
- Pick up list by 6:30 AM In the pulm/ID fellows workroom on the 2nd
    floor (between team 4 workroom and the MICU), sign-out at 6 PM
- Admitting: Teams 1-3-5 & 2-4-6 alternate admitting days and admit
    until 5:30 PM
- Non-admitting teams can sign out once their work Is complete as
    early as 2PM on weekdays and 12PM on weekends
- Rounds alternate at 7 AM on admitting days, 8 AM on non-admitting
    days, meet at workrooms; night admitting team presents to attendings
    at 7 AM (depending on team)
- Work rooms:
    - Team 1 on 2N hallway, past RN station
    - Team 2 on 2N hallway, past RN station
    - Team 3 on 2N hallway, between main elevators and RN station
    - Team 4 at 2nd floor adjacent to main elevators
    - Team 5 on 3N hallway
    - Team 6 in pulm & ID fellow workroom outside MICU on 2G
- Tips: Admission days can be very busy and anything you can get done
    on the non-admitting days will make your life easier (ex: DIPNs).
    Ensure that you tag PCP on EVERY H&P so they know patient is
    admitted (right click signed H&P -\> dropdown menu -\> "identify
    additional co-signer"), make documents in OneDrive (it's
    HIPAA-compliant!) to use as your pre-rounding sheet and sign-out
    sheet and share these with your team (for days off); roll your
    pagers via Vanderbilt operator (same as at VU); ensure all orders on
    patients still in the ED are “delayed” or they will disappear once
    on the floor (ask your resident); all consults must be accompanied
    by page to the covering fellow (use Synergy for medicine
    subspecialties consult schedule, TVHS website for surgery/other),
    beware that medications disappear after 1 month of admission (your
    pharmacist can help!), beware that diets disappear when converting
    obs to inpatient, enjoy a complimentary VA square!

## VA MICU

- Team: 3 Res, 3 Interns, no specific patient cap
- Combined CCU and MICU; 7AM CCU rounds followed by 8AM MICU rounds
- Day Intern: 7 AM - 9 PM; Night Intern 8 PM - 10 AM; MICU between 2N
    and 2G (2nd floor)
- Tips: Night intern presents all of the old patients in the morning
    and signs the notes. The day intern owns the A&P of the notes by
    keeping them updated. Never hesitate to relay information to your
    resident overnight if you are concerned (wake him/her up!)

    clinic resident), Friday night for admitting resident (covered by

- Tips: Admissions typically bolus at the start of shift and slow
    later in the night, so worry about seeing pts, formulating plans
    with resident and putting in orders first as notes can be finished
    once it slows down, cafeteria at VU closes at 2 AM, communicate
    everything you do with your resident who is supervising a second
    intern as well, ensure all orders on pts still in the ED are
    “delayed” or they will disappear once on the floor (ask your
    resident), enjoy a complimentary VA square for breakfast!
