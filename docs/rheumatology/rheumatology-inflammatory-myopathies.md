# Inflammatory Myopathies

## Background
-	Heterogenous group of disorders that classically present with proximal muscle weakness, although some may present with systemic features (ILD, rashes, inflammatory arthritis, mechanics hands, Raynaud phenomenon)
-	Subtypes: dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis (PM), antisynthetase antibody syndrome associated myositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy (IMNM), inclusion body myositis (IBM)
-	Additional myopathies: statin-induced myopathy, metabolic (hypothyroid, electrolyte), viral/infection myositis, diabetic myonecrosis
-	Important point: PMR= painful, preserved strength vs inflammatory myopathy = painless weakness
-	Consider screening patients for underlying malignancy – up to 15-30% of cases are associated with malignancy 

## Presentation 
-	Acute vs. Chronic
    -	Acute or subacute: DM, PM, IMNM
    -	Gradual and progressive: IBM
-	Distribution of weakness
    -	Proximal and symmetric: DM, PM, IMNM
    -	Distal and asymmetric: IBM (often involves weakness of finger flexor muscles)
-	Systemic signs or symptoms: fever, rash, dyspnea, dysphagia, arthritis
    -	DM: Gottron’s papules, heliotrope rash, shawl sign, mechanics hands
    -	Anti-synthetase syndrome: cough/dyspnea, arthritis, Raynaud’s or mechanics hands
    -	IBM: can present with dysphagia; advanced cases may present with muscle atrophy
-	Consider patient’s medications including statins and chronic prednisone 

## Evaluation
-	Labs: CMP, TSH, CK level, LDH and aldolase
-	Extended myositis panel (screens of antibodies that include but are not limited to anti-Jo1 and anti-Mi2)
    -	MDA5 Ab is associated with rapidly progressing ILD, which may present with AHRF
    -	TIF1 and NXP2 Abs are associated with underlying malignancy
-	EMG: useful for ruling out neuromuscular etiologies 
-	MRI extremity/affected muscle group: can help guide biopsies and evaluate edema on T2 and STIR (high signal intensity on these sequences may reflect active inflammation) and fatty replacement (reflects muscle damage) on T1. 
-	Skin biopsy in dermatomyositis: “interface dermatitis,” notably the same findings as skin biopsy of lupus rashes
-	Muscle biopsy: gold standard for diagnosis
    -	Do not do biopsy in same muscle as EMG done
    -	Dermatomyositis: perifascicular and perivascular inflammatory infiltrate (CD4 T cells and pDCs)
    -	Polymyositis: endomysial inflammatory infiltrate (CD8 T cells)
    -	IMNM: muscle fibers in various stages of necrosis, scant inflammatory infiltrate
    -	IBM: endomysial inflammatory infiltrate, intracellular vacuoles, protein aggregation

## Management
-	Consult Rheumatology 
-	1st line for DM and PM: high dose steroids (1mg/kg/day prednisone) for 4-6 weeks PLUS steroid sparing treatment (methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil)
    -	Can add IVIG for severe cases if cost is not an issue 
-	1st line for IMNM: high dose steroids for 4-6 weeks PLUS IVIG and rituximab
-	If statin induced: stop statin or switch to lower intensity
-	Refractory cases: abatacept or tofacitinib
