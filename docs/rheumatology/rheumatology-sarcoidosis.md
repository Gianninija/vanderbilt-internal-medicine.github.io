# Sarcoidosis

## Background
-	Multisystem disordered defined by forming noncaseating granulomas in different tissues

## Presentation
-	Constitutional symptoms: fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, fevers, arthralgias, myalgias
-	Pulmonary symptoms (most common): dyspnea, cough, and chest pain 
-	Extrapulmonary manifestations
    -	Cutaneous: Highly variable, but present in 25% of patients
        -	Papules, macules, or plaques commonly involving neck, upper back, extremities
        -	Lupus pernio: indurated, violaceous bumps on nose, lips, cheeks, ears
        -	Erythema nodosum
    -	Neuro
        -	Affects 5-10% of patients; involving any part of CNS or PNS
        -	CN palsies, hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction, seizures, myelopathy or radiculopathy, hydrocephalus, aseptic meningitis
    -	Cardiac
        -	Granulomas can affect pericardium, myocardium and endocardium resulting in valvular disorders, conduction system and cardiomyopathy
        -	Arrhythmias are most common manifestation
    -	Liver/Spleen
        -	Granulomas in liver and spleen can lead to elevated LFTs, cirrhosis, anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (splenic sequestration)
    -	Ocular
        -	Uveitis, secondary glaucoma, retinal vasculitis, keratoconjunctivitis
    -	Lofgren Syndrome
        -	Acute presentation with fever, bilateral hilar adenopathy, erythema nodosum or ankle arthralgia 
-	Incidental finding in chest imaging: >90% of patients have pulmonary or thoracic lymphadenopathy on presentation and ~50% of patients present with only incidental radiological findings

## Evaluation
-	Combination of clinical features, radiographic manifestations, exclusion of other similarly presenting diseases, and noncaseating granulomas on pathology 
-	CXR: hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy ± pulmonary infiltrates. CXR stages are defined as below (stages do not represent disease activity)
    -	Stage 1: bilateral hilar adenopathy only
    -	Stage 2: bilateral hilar adenopathy + pulmonary infiltrates
    -	Stage 3: pulmonary infiltrates without hilar adenopathy
    -	Stage 4: pulmonary fibrosis that mainly involves upper lung zones  
-	High-Resolution chest CT: Lymphadenopathy (bilateral and symmetric), perilymphatic micro or macronodules, fibrotic changes (reticular opacities, traction bronchiectasis, volume loss, cysts)
-	PFTs: may show restrictive disease (decreased TLC & VC) and diffusion impairment (reduced DLCO). Occasionally obstructive with endobronchial disease.
-	Labs: CBC w/ diff, CMP, UA, quant-gold for TB or tuberculin skin test, HIV. Depending on endemic fungi, serologic testing for histoplasmosis or coccidiomycosis can also be included.
-	ECG: should be obtained since AV block is the most common finding of cardiac sarcoidosis. 
-	Biopsy
    -	Important to rule out mimics. The differential for “noncaseating granulomas” is extensive, including lymphoma and fungal infections
    -	Not required for patients with asymptomatic bilateral hilar adenopathy or pathognomonic presentations including Lofgren syndrome and some cases of lupus pernio

## Management 
-	Most do not require therapy: monitor symptoms, CXR, PFTs at 3-6 month intervals 
-	Indications for treatment: progressive disease or severe disease at presentation 
-	Mainstay of treatment is oral steroids
    -	Dosing usually 0.3-0.6 mg/kg daily for 4-6 weeks
    -	If only symptom is cough, could consider inhaled glucocorticoids
    -	If unresponsive or unable to tolerate steroids may require alternative agents (MTX, AZA, TNFi)
