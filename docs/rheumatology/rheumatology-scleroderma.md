# Scleroderma (Systemic Sclerosis) 

Eva Niklinska and Raeann Whitney

## Background
-	Distinguish from localized scleroderma (morphea or linear scleroderma) which is dermal fibrosis without internal organ involvement
-	2 Major Subtypes of Generalized / Systemic Scleroderma (SSc):
    -	Limited cutaneous (lcSSc): Skin thickening limited to the neck, face, or distal to elbows and knees; spares the truck and proximal extremities. Raynaud’s may develop years before other manifestations, which then slowly accumulate over 5-10 years.
        - + anticentromere antibody
        - + Renal crisis is rare
        - High risk for developing PAH 
    - Diffuse cutaneous: skin thickening extends proximal to the elbows/knees or trunk; rapid development of cutaneous and multiorgan involvement
        - More associated with anti-Scl-70 ab
        - Typically more abrupt onset and rapid progression compared to limited
        - High risk for progressive ILD
        - + RNA polymerase III Ab = high risk of renal crisis, higher risk for malignancy 

## Presentation
-	CREST: Calcinosis cutis, Raynaud phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility, Sclerodactyly, Telangiectasia (CREST syndrome is no longer a discrete diagnosis but incorporated into lcSSc) 
-	Systemic: fatigue, weight loss 
-	Vascular: Raynaud’s +/- digital tip ulcers, telangiectasias, nailfold capillaroscopy with dilated capillary loops
-	Skin: Sclerodactyly, loss of facial wrinkles, decreased oral aperture 
-	MSK: arthralgias, myalgias, flexion contractures 
-	GI: Esophageal or intestinal dysmotility, GERD, GAVE (watermelon stomach)
-	Pulm: ILD (NSIP, UIP), pulmonary arterial hypertension 
-	Cardiac: pericardial effusions, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy, conduction system disease  
-	Renal: renal crisis (onset of malignant HTN, greatest risk in first 5 years) 

## Evaluation 
-	2013 ACR/EULAR Classification Criteria à weight-based symptom scoring  
-	Labs: ANA w/ Reflex, Scl70, anticentromere, RNA pol III (separate order in Epic, increased risk of scleroderma renal disease) 
-	Imaging/Procedures: Baseline PFTs, lung HRCT, TTE, EKG, 6-minute walk test 
-	Skin biopsy: Not often used for dx, may be required to differentiate other rare disorders (eosinophilic fasciitis, scleroderma, scleromyxedema)

## Management
-	Organ-Based Symptomatic Therapy
    -	Raynauds: CCB (amlodipine, nifedipine), topical nitroglycerin
    -	GERD: PPI
    -	Renal: Monitor BP and Cr
- Scleroderma renal crisis: Abrupt onset of HTN and renal dysfunction that typically presents early in disease course (can precede skin thickening)
    - Labs: Elevated Cr, proteinuria, MAHA, elevated renin
    - Treatment: Short acting ACEi (captopril, enalapril), may require HD
- ILD: Periodic PFTs (isolated DLCO may suggest PAH); monitor for respiratory symptoms, pulmonology referral
- Cardiac/PAH: annual TTE, cardiology referral 
- Systemic Immunosuppression (if progressive skin thickening or organ involvement)  
    - MTX, MMF, cyclophosphamide, if refractory rituximab, IVIG
    - Nintedanib may be used in combination with immunosuppression
