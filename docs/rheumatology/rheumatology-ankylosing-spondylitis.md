# Ankylosing Spondylitis

## Background and Classification
-	Spondyloarthritis: designates a group of diseases classified as either axial or peripheral
-	Historically associated with a family of arthridities: ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, peripheral arthritis, uveitis, IBD, and presence of HLA-B27 gene
-	HLA-B27 is strongly linked to disease susceptibility; however, AS can occur in absence of the gene and only ~3% of HLA-B27 positive subjects develop AS

## Presentation
- Onset generally occurs in late adolescence of early adulthood
- MSK: Inflammatory back pain (hallmark), alternating buttock pain with sacroiliac involvement, enthesitis
- Extraarticular: Acute anterior uveitis, psoriasis, IBD
- Typically encompasses 4/5 features: age of onset <40 years, insidious onset, improvement with exercise, no improvement with rest, pain at night (improvement upon arising)

## Evaluation
- Labs: No specific laboratory tests for AS
    - HLA-B27 is often present, though not necessary for diagnosis
    - Elevated CRP and ESR in 50-70% of pts with active AS and less frequently elevated in pts with non-radiographic subtype
- Imaging
    - X-ray and MRI: joint space narrowing and sclerosis secondary to erosive changes in SI joint, pelvis, and/or spine; bony ankylosis /fusion can eventually be seen in progressive disease
    - MRI can reveal inflammatory changes; helpful in non-radiographic (X-ray negative) subtype
- Classification criteria is used for diagnostic purposes
   - Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society Criteria (2011): ≥3mos back pain before 45yo and either sacroiliitis on imaging + ≥1 other axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) feature OR HLA-B27 positive + ≥2 SpA features
   - SpA features: arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis, psoriasis, IBD, uveitis, FHx, HLA-B27

## Management
- Initial therapy: NSAIDs for symptomatic axial spondyloarthropathies. Occasionally NSAIDs alone improve symptoms and are the only medications required
- Refractory symptoms: TNF inhibitors followed by IL-17 inhibitors (second option, most effective in pts with concomitant psoriasis). JAK inhibitors are also improved.
- Physical therapy: intensive rehabilitation and exercise improve mobility and symptoms
