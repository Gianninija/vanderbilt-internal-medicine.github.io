Serologic testing must be interpreted in the clinical context. ANA,
ANCA, and even specific antibodies without typical manifestations of the
disease are of unclear clinical significance

Anti-nuclear Antibodies (ANA)

- Always send with reflex (if ≥ 1:80, will check for dsDNA, Sm, SSA,
    SSB, Scl70, RNP)

<!-- -->

- At VUMC, 1:80 is considered “positive”; a higher titer is more
    specific for ANA-associated rheumatologic disease

    - \~30% of the general population has a “positive” ANA at 1:40,
        most clinically significant ANAs are at least 1:160

- Common Patterns

    - Smooth/homogenous – associated with Anti-dsDNA and Anti-histone
        antibodies

    - Speckled – associated with Anti-RNP, Anti-Smith, Anti-SSA/Ro,
        Anti-SSB/La

    - Nucleolar – associated with Anti-Scl-70

<!-- -->

- Specific types of ANAs:

<!-- -->

- Anti-dsDNA: High levels (\>150) are usually specific for SLE. Can
    correlate with disease activity, a/w renal disease

- Anti-Smith (Qualitative): Very specific for SLE but not sensitive

- Anti-SSA/Ro

    - Classic for Sjogren’s but non-specific; can also be seen in SLE,
        MCTD, myositis, etc

    - Maternal positivity for SSA is associated with congenital heart
        block in infants

- Anti-SSB/La: Similar profile to Anti-SSA/Ro but less common

- Anti-Scl-70: Specific for systemic sclerosis, most associated with
    diffuse cutaneous disease

- Anti-RNP: Required for MCTD diagnosis, can also be seen in SLE

<!-- -->

- Anti-histone: drug-induced lupus

- Anti-centromere: limited scleroderma, a/w pulmonary HTN

- Anti-RNA polymerase III: increased risk of scleroderma renal disease

Anti-neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA)

- Qualitative: p-ANCA, c-ANCA, negative, or indeterminate

- Quantitative titers: anti-proteinase 3 (PR3), anti-myeloperoxidase
    (MPO) IgG antibodies

- See vasculitis section for further details

C3 and C4

- Hypocomplementemia in active SLE (due to increased consumption)

- Complement may also be low in diseases that decreases the liver’s
    synthetic function

- ↓ C3/C4 in other diseases that form immune complexes, activating the
    classic complement pathway: mixed cryoglobulinemia, Sjogren’s, MPGN,
    and antiphospholipid syndrome

C-reactive Protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)

- Both tests are non-specific markers of inflammation

- CRP measures a specific acute phase protein made by the liver

<!-- -->

- IL-6 dependent (pts anti-IL6 therapy will have falsely decreased
    CRP)

- Typically changes more rapidly than ESR as it is a direct measure of
    acute phase reactant

<!-- -->

- ESR is the rate at which RBCs settle to the bottom of a test tube

<!-- -->

- Presence of positively charged proteins disrupt the self-repelling
    negative charges of RBCs clumping (rouleaux formation) increased
    rate of sedimentation

    - ESR will increase in states with increased antibodies, acute
        phase proteins, etc

- Falsely low ESR: low fibrinogen states (DIC, HLH), sickle cell,
    polycythemia

Creatinine Kinase (CK)

- CK can be elevated by vigorous exercise, rhabdomyolysis,
    endocrinopathy, cardiac disease, renal disease, malignancy,
    medication effect, neuromuscular disease, connective tissue disease

- Consider inflammatory myopathies if there is elevated CK and
    objective proximal muscle weakness

- Notably, CK is normal in polymyalgia rheumatica

Extended Myositis Panel

- Ordered as “Myositis extended Pnl-ARUP”; includes 19 separate Abs

- Can be sent when suspecting various forms of myositis such as
    dermatomyositis, polymyositis, anti-synthetase syndrome (ex- ILD
    work-up)

Cryoglobulins

- Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that spontaneously precipitate at
    low temperatures and become soluble again with rewarming

- Reported as qualitative (positive or negative) and quantitative
    (percentage = “cryocrit”)

<!-- -->

- Cryoglobulin last test is highly prone to collection error; must be
    collected in pre-warmed tubes and maintained at body temperature
    during collection and delivery to the lab;

- At VUMC can only be obtained at certain times M-F; lab & nursing
    staff can coordinate

<!-- -->

- Cryoglobulins are classified into three types: Type I, II, and III

<!-- -->

- Type I Cryoglobulins: Monoclonal immunoglobulins (IgM or IgG)

    - A/w lymphoproliferative disorders (Waldenström’s, MM, CLL, B
        cell lymphomas)

<!-- -->

- Types II and III are Mixed Cryoglobulins (they contain polyclonal
    components)

<!-- -->

- Essentially all mixed cryoglobulinemias will be RF+ \*

- Commonly associated with HCV (\~90%); also CTD

- Type II: *monoclonal* Ig with RF activity against *polyclonal* Igs

- Type III: *polyclonal* Ig with RF against *polyclonal* Igs

    \*RF activity by definition is the reactivity of an IgM component
    with the Fc portion of an IgG

<!-- -->

- Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis: small vessel vasculitis, vascular
    deposition of cryoprecipitates

<!-- -->

- Skin most common: palpable purpura, usually in lower extremities
    (colder areas), immune-complex mediated leukocytoclastic vasculitis
    on biopsy

- Additional manifestations include: Arthralgias, peripheral motor or
    sensory neuropathy, sicca, glomerulonephritis (usually MPGN)

Rheumatoid Arthritis – Raeann Whitney

Background

- Inflammation and proliferation of synovial tissue, loss of articular
    cartilage, erosion of juxtarticular bone

- Female predominant (\~3:1), mostly child-bearing age at onset

- Chronic, inflammatory polyarthritis affecting the small joints of
    the hands (MCPs, PIPs, classically spares DIPs), wrists, feet,
    ankles - typically *symmetric*

- Ulnar deviation, swan neck, boutonniere deformities are late
    findings of untreated disease

- Morning stiffness lasting \>30 min (often 1 hr+) suggests
    inflammatory arthritis (not specific)

- Extra-articular manifestations include: sicca symptoms, scleritis,
    ILD, pulm nodules, serositis, constrictive pericarditis, anemia,
    mononeuritis multiplex, rheumatoid nodules, rheumatoid vasculitis.
    Increased risk of lymphoma, osteoporosis

- C1-C2 instability: pts need evaluation with imaging prior to
    surgical procedure/intubation

Evaluation

- Clinical diagnosis + positive RF, anti-CCP. Note up to 15-20%
    patients have seronegative RA

<!-- -->

- RF is more sensitive but not specific; can be + in HBV/HCV,
    cryoglobulinemia

- CCP is less sensitive but more specific

<!-- -->

- CBC, CMP, CRP, ESR, HIV, Hepatitis B and C screening; Quantiferon
    Gold (biologics)

- Obtain hand and foot films to assess for periarticular osteopenia &
    typical marginal erosions

Management

- The majority of joint damage occurs early in the disease so early
    treatment paramount

- DMARDs: typically start with MTX; may require biologics such as TNF
    inhibitors

<!-- -->

- MTX dosed weekly; required daily 1 mg folic acid supplement

    - Toxicities: oral ulcers, bone marrow suppression, liver
        toxicity, pneumonitis, teratogenic (contraception required)

<!-- -->

- Symptomatic/Flare treatment (no impact on disease progression):

<!-- -->

- Steroids at low-moderate dosage (e.g., prednisone 15-20mg/day);
    NSAIDs (high doses required for anti-inflammatory effects)

Systemic Lupus Erythematous – Eva Niklinska

Background

- Characterized by multisystem inflammation, activation of complement,
    autoantibody formation

- Presentation:

<!-- -->

- Constitutional: fatigue, fevers, weight loss

- Neurologic: cerebritis, myelitis, mononeuritis multiplex, psychosis

- Skin: malar rash (spares nasolabial folds), discoid lesions
    (scarring), photosensitivity

- Hematologic: leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia

- Pulmonary: pleuritis, pleural effusion, ILD

- Cardiac: pericarditis/myocarditis, increased risk for CAD,
    Libman-Sacks endocarditis

- Renal: nephritic/nephrotic syndrome

- MSK: arthralgias, myalgias, arthritis (nonerosive, often symmetric)

- Ophtho: keratoconjunctivitis sicca 2/2 concurrent Sjogren’s

Evaluation

- Labs to check upon admission: dsDNA (don’t re-send ANA/ENA panel if
    known ddx), C3/C4, ESR, CRP, CBC w/ diff, CMP, UPC

- 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for diagnosis:

<!-- -->

- ANA (≥ 1:80) + additive scoring (classify as SLE if score is 10+)

- Do not count criteria if there is a more likely explanation for it

- Occurrence of a criterion on one occasion is sufficient. Criteria do
    not need to occur simultaneously. At least one criterion must be
    clinical

<!-- -->

- Ddx: RA, MCTD, SS, Sjogren’s, Vasculitis (Behcet’s), PM/DM,
    Fibromyalgia 

- \* Note + ANA is now entry criteria \[ANA only needs to be + once\]

Management

- Hydroxychloroquine mainstay of treatment, 200-400 mg/day; dose 5
    mg/kg/day for long term to decrease risk of retinal toxicity

<!-- -->

- Safe in pregnancy; decreases VTE/HLD risk 

- Annual ophtho exam for retinal toxicity 

- NOT immunosuppressive

<!-- -->

- Glucocorticoids for flares: Usually started with hydroxychloroquine
    and tapered once hydroxychloroquine has taken effect

- Other immunosuppressive medications (MTX, MMF, AZA, RTX) used with
    rheumatology consultation: MMF, cyclophosphamide or other advanced
    therapies used in SLE with renal involvement or severe end organ
    involvement

Scleroderma (Systemic Sclerosis) – Eva Niklinska and Raeann Whitney

Background

- Distinguish from localized scleroderma (morphea or linear
    scleroderma) = dermal fibrosis w/o internal organ involvement)

- 2 Major Subtypes of Generalized / Systemic Scleroderma (SSc):

<!-- -->

- Limited Cutaneous (lcSSc): skin thickening limited to the neck,
    face, or distal to elbows and knees; spares the truck and proximal
    extremities

    - Limited does not equal mild, limited refers to distribution of
        skin involvement

    - Renal crisis is rare

    - Patients with + ACA (anticentromere Ab) are at high risk for
        developing PAH

    - Patients with + Anti-Scl-70 Ab are also at high risk for
        progressive ILD

- Diffuse Cutaneous: skin thickening extends proximal to the
    elbows/knees or trunk

    - Typically more abrupt onset and rapid progression compared to
        lcSSc

    - High risk for progressive ILD

    - \+ RNA polymerase III Ab = high risk of renal crisis, higher
        risk for malignancy

Presentation

- CREST: Calcinosis cutis, Raynaud phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility,
    Sclerodactyly, Telangiectasia (CREST syndrome is no longer a
    discrete diagnosis)

- Systemic: fatigue, weight loss

- Vascular: Raynaud’s +/- digital tip ulcers, telangiectasias,
    nailfold capillaroscopy w/ dilated capillary loops

- Skin: Loss of facial wrinkles, decreased oral aperture

- MSK: arthralgias, myalgias, flexion contractures

- GI: Esophageal or intestinal dysmotility, GERD, GAVE (watermelon
    stomach)

- Pulm: ILD (NSIP, UIP), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)

- Cardiac: pericardial effusions, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy,
    conduction system disease

- Renal: renal crisis (onset of malignant HTN, greatest risk in first
    5 years)

- Labs: ANA w/ Reflex, Scl70, anticentromere, RNA pol III (separate
    order in Epic)

- Imaging/Procedures: Baseline PFTs, Lung HRCT, TTE, EKG, 6-minute
    walk test

- Skin biopsy: Not often used for dx, may be required to differentiate
    other rare disorders (eosinophilic fasciitis, scleroderma,
    scleromyxedema)

Management

- Organ-Based Symptomatic Therapy

<!-- -->

- Raynauds: CCB (amlodipine, nifedipine), topical nitroglycerin

- GERD: PPI

- Renal: Monitor BP; Cr

- ILD: Periodic PFTs, monitor for new respiratory symptoms, pulm
    referral

- Cardiac/PAH: annual TTE, cardiology referral

<!-- -->

- Systemic Immunosuppression (if progressive skin thickening or organ
    involvement)

<!-- -->

- MTX, MMF, cyclophosphamide, if refractory rituximab, IVIG 

Scleroderma Renal Crisis

- Typically presents early in disease course (can even precede skin
    thickening)

- Abrupt onset of hypertension and renal dysfunction

- Labs: Elevated Cr, proteinuria, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia,
    elevated renin

- Treatment: short acting ACE (captopril or enalapril, titratable),
    may require HD

Anti-Phospholipid Syndrome – Gautam Babu

Background

- Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) = a heterogenous group of
    autoantibodies which interact with endothelial cells through binding
    of β2GPI receptor

- APLs induce a procoagulant and proinflammatory endothelial phenotype
    arterial, venous, small vessel thromboembolic events, or pregnancy
    losses

Presentation

- Unexplained/recurrent venous, arterial, and/or small vessel
    thromboembolic events

<!-- -->

- Venous: DVT most common

- Arterial: cerebral, renal, mesenteric, coronary, PE

<!-- -->

- Pregnancy morbidity: recurrent, unexplained spontaneous abortions,
    fetal loss, preterm birth due to preeclampsia, placental
    insufficiency

- Other features: nonbacterial vegetations (Libman-Sachs
    endocarditis), thrombocytopenia, livedo reticularis

Evaluation

- Revised Sapporo classification criteria: At least one of the
    clinical criteria and one of the laboratory criteria are met:

<!-- -->

- Vascular thrombosis (arterial, small vessel, or venous)

- Pregnancy morbidity

- Antiphospholipid lab testing: must be present on two or more
    occasions at least 12 weeks apart (NOT TESTED INPATIENT) Lupus
    anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody (IgG or IgM, medium or high
    titer) anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-I antibody (IgG or IgM)

Management

- Mainstay is anticoagulation for treatment and secondary prevention

- Acute thromboembolism: Heparin gtt with bridge to warfarin

- Secondary thrombosis prevention, anticoagulation with warfarin is
    preferred

<!-- -->

- Studies suggest that DOACs are less effective than warfarin

- Goal INR 2-3 regardless of whether arterial or venous
    thromboembolism present

<!-- -->

- ASA 81 mg + warfarin for pts w/arterial events and risks for ASCVD

Catastrophic Anti-phospholipid Syndrome (CAPS) – Gautam Babu

Background

- Rapid development of thromboses in multiple small blood vessels in
    various organs resulting in multi-organ failure. Occurs in a small
    subset of patients with APS

Presentation

- Similar presentation to APS, but multiple organs are involved in a
    short period of time

- Renal (hypertension, proteinuria, hematuria, acute renal failure),
    Pulmonary (ARDS, PE), Central Nervous System (encephalopathy,
    stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis), Cardiac (coronary thrombosis),
    and Cutaneous (livedo reticularis, acrocyanosis, purpura,
    ecchymosis, splinter hemorrhages, and necrosis resulting in
    ulceration)

Evaluation

- Exclude other causes of small vessel occlusion: HIT, DIC or TMA

- Definite dx= all 4 criteria met, probable dx=combination of criteria
    present

<!-- -->

- Evidence of involvement of three or more organs, systems, and/or
    tissues

- Development of manifestations simultaneously or in less than a week

- Confirmation by histopathology of small vessel occlusion in at least
    one organ or tissue

- Laboratory confirmation of the presence of antiphospholipid
    antibodies

Management

- Anticoagulation: Heparin acutely. Warfarin once stable & no bleeding
    or recurrent thromboses

- Pulse steroids with methylprednisolone x 3 days followed by
    prednisone

- Severe cases may require PLEX/IVIG. Refractory CAPS may require
    rituximab or eculizumab

Sarcoidosis – Jared Freitas

Background

- Multisystem disordered defined by forming noncaseating granulomas in
    different tissues

- Cardiac and neuro manifestations can be isolated

Presentation

- Constitutional symptoms: fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, fevers,
    arthralgias, myalgias

- Pulmonary symptoms (most common): dyspnea, cough, and wheezing

- Extrapulmonary manifestations:

<!-- -->

- Cutaneous: Highly variable, but present in 25% of patients

    - Papules, macules, or plaques commonly involving neck, upper
        back, extremities

    - Lupus pernio: indurated, violaceous bumps on nose, lips, cheeks,
        ears

    - Erythema nodosum

- Neuro

    - Affects 5-10% pts; involving any part of CNS or PNS

    - CN palsies, hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction, seizures,
        myelopathy or radiculopathy, hydrocephalus, aseptic meningitis

- Cardiac

    - Granulomas can affect pericardium, myocardium and endocardium
        resulting in valvular disorders, conduction system and
        cardiomyopathy

- Liver/Spleen

    - Granulomas in liver and spleen can lead to elevated LFTs,
        cirrhosis, anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (splenic
        sequestration)

- Ocular

    - Uveitis, secondary glaucoma, retinal vasculitis,
        keratoconjunctivitis

Work Up

- Combination of clinical features, radiographic manifestations,
    exclusion of other similarly presenting diseases, and noncaseating
    granulomas on pathology

<!-- -->

- CXR: hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy ± pulmonary infiltrates

- High-Resolution Chest CT

    - Lymphadenopathy (bilateral and symmetric), with micro or
        macronodules, fibrotic changes (reticular opacities, traction
        bronchiectasis, volume loss)

- PFTs

    - May show restrictive disease (decreased TLC & VC) and diffusion
        impairment (reduced DLCO). Occasionally obstructive with
        endobronchial disease.

- Labs: CBC w/ diff, CMP, UA, quant-gold for TB. ACE level is of
    limited clinical use

- Biopsy

    - Important to rule out mimics. The differential for “noncaseating
        granulomas” is extensive, including lymphoma and fungal
        infections.

    - Not required for pts w/ asymptomatic bilateral hilar adenopathy
        or Lofgren syndrome (fever, erythema nodosum, arthralgias, and
        bilateral hilar LAD)

Management

- Most pts do not require therapy: monitor symptoms, CXR, PFTs at 3-6
    month intervals

- Indications for treatment: progressive disease or severe disease at
    presentation

- Mainstay of treatment is oral steroids:

<!-- -->

- Dosing usually 0.3-0.6 mg/kg daily for 4-6 weeks

- If only symptoms is cough, could consider inhaled glucocorticoids

<!-- -->

- If unresponsive or unable to tolerate steroids may require
    alternative agents (MTX, AZA)

Crystalline Arthropathies – Thomas Horton

Gout

Presentation

- Red, hot, swollen joint (classically affects 1st metatarsal
    phalangeal joint \[podagra\])

- May progress to involve ankles, knees, elbows, and small joints of
    hand if untreated

<!-- -->

- Flares may also become polyarticular over time

<!-- -->

- Gout is diagnosed with combination of clinical presentation and
    arthrocentesis results

- Lifestyle factors:

<!-- -->

- Protective: Low fat dairy, hydration, weight loss, smoking cessation

- Promoting: Meat, seafood, alcohol, high fructose corn syrup,
    medications that lead to hyperuricemia (ex: thiazides)

Evaluation

- Synovial Fluid Analysis: 

<!-- -->

- Cell count and differential: WBC 20,000-100,000, \> 50% neutrophils

- Order gram stain/culture (It is possible to have septic arthritis
    and gout)

- Examination for crystals under polarizing light microscopy: (order
    “Synovial Fluid Eval” so the lab knows to look for crystals)

    - Monosodium urate crystals: needle-shaped and negatively
        birefringent and appear yellow when parallel to the polarizer

<!-- -->

- Imaging: generally unnecessary

<!-- -->

- MSK ultrasound: "Double contour sign" (hyperechoic band = urate
    crystals deposits)

- Radiographs: Punched out erosions or lytic areas with overhanging
    edges

- Dual energy CT scan: gout crystal aggregates appear green. Not
    routinely necessary; Do not order without rheumatology consult

Management

Acute:

- Do not discontinue allopurinol during an acute gout attack

- NSAIDs (if not contraindicated): Short course (2-5 days) at full
    anti-inflammatory dose: ibuprofen 800 mg TID, indomethacin 50 mg
    TID, naproxen 500 mg BID

- Colchicine (avoid if GFR \<10 mL/min. Dose reduce by 50% if GFR \<50
    mL/min)

<!-- -->

- Best if used within the first 36 hours of an attack. Much less
    effective if started later.

- Dosing: 1.2 mg then 0.6 mg one hour later, then 0.6 mg daily until
    clinical improvement

    - Note drug interactions that may require dose adjustment of
        colchicine: Statins, diltiazem, fluconazole, cyclosporine,
        tacrolimus, clarithromycin, etc.

<!-- -->

- Steroids:

<!-- -->

- Ideally intra-articular if single joint affected and infection has
    been ruled out

- Oral prednisone, dose 0.5mg/kg/day until clinical improvement then
    taper over 7-14 days

<!-- -->

- Anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist): 100mg once daily for three days
    (or QOD for CrCl \<30). Requires rheumatology consult. For patients
    with contraindications to all other treatments

Chronic:

- Urate Lowering Therapy (ULT)

<!-- -->

- Indications: Strong: \>2 attacks/year, one or more subcutaneous
    tophi, radiologic changes. Conditional: CKD 3 or worse,
    urolithiasis, serum urate \>9

- Goal serum urate: \<6.0 mg/dL, or \<5.0 mg/dL in patients with tophi

- ULT can precipitate an acute gout flare and should always be started
    with low-dose NSAIDs, colchicine (0.6 mg) or prednisone (5 mg daily
    or QOD)

    - Prophylaxis should be continued for at least 6 months until uric
        acid is at goal and tophi have resolved

- Allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor): Start low at 100 mg per
    day (sometimes even 50mg daily in those with advanced CKD) and
    increase as needed for target uric acid \<6 (most patients will need
    400-800 mg daily)

    - Adjust dose monthly (3-4 weeks). In kidney dysfunction go
        slower.

    - Titration of allopurinol ↓ both the risk of acute gout attacks
        and DRESS syndrome

    - Genetic testing (HLA-B\*5801) recommended prior to starting for
        pts of Asian and African descent given ↑ incidence of
        allopurinol hypersensitivity if + positive allele

- Febuxostat: alternative xanthine oxidase inhibitor that is
    metabolized by the liver for pts at risk for DRESS or SJS related to
    allopurinol. Black box warning for ↑ cardiovascular risk; more
    expensive than allopurinol

<!-- -->

- Consider Rheumatology consult for patients with refractory serum
    urate levels \>6.0 on XOI

Additional pearls

- There is a microscope in the rheumatology clinic at VUMC (TVC 2);
    You can page the rheumatology fellow and they are happy to help you
    use it

- Uric acid level is often normal during acute gout flare

- Shifts in uric acid may be the trigger of the flare: Diuresis,
    dietary changes, hospital stays

- Eliminating uric acid from the diet only reduces uric acid by \~1
    mg/dL. Urate lowering therapy will be needed in most patients even
    if diet changed

- VA specific guidance:

<!-- -->

- Colchicine is non-formulary but is easily approved

- For steroid intra-articular injections triamcinolone is the
    formulary option

Pseudogout- Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease
(CPPD)

Presentation

- Red, hot, swollen joint usually in the wrists, knees, or MCP joints

- Cannot distinguish from gout based on clinical features alone. Like
    gout, diagnosis is based on exam and arthrocentesis

- More prevalent in the elderly populations

Evaluation

- Synovial Fluid:

<!-- -->

- Cell count and differential: WBC 20,000 to 100,000, \>50%
    neutrophils

- Order gram stain/culture (It is possible to have septic arthritis
    and CPPD)

- Examination for crystals under polarizing light microscopy

    - CPPD crystals: rhomboid-shaped, weakly positively birefringent
        and appear blue when parallel to the polarizer

<!-- -->

- Imaging: 

<!-- -->

- XR: chondrocalcinosis (thin calcified line present in
    fibrocartilage) in the joint space (easiest to see in knee and
    wrists)

Management

- Typically follows the same treatment used for acute gout attacks
    (see above, little evidence)

- Some patients may develop Chronic CPP Crystal Inflammatory
    Arthritis.

    - Resembles RA in presentation

    - Treatment base on symptoms and ranges from NSAIDs (1st line) to
        > Colchicine, HCQ, and steroids. Can also use anakinra in acute
        > cases, with consult to rheumatology

        Additional Information

- CPPD can be associated with other disorders: hyperparathyroidism,
    hemochromatosis, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and familial
    hypocalciuric hypercalcemia

    - Consider further workup for these conditions, especially in a
        > younger patient.

Vasculitis – Hannah Angle

Background

- Large vessel vasculitis (aorta and its major branches)

<!-- -->

- Takayasu arteritis:

    - Most commonly \<30 years old, 80-90% cases in females, greatest
        prevalence in Asia

    - Branches of aorta/aortic arch (subclavian, innominate, carotid
        arteries)

- Giant cell Arteritis:

    - Most commonly \>50 years old, slight F \> M predominance

    - Cranial arteries (temporal artery), aorta and its branches

<!-- -->

- Medium vessel vasculitis (muscular arteries that supply visceral
    organs)

<!-- -->

- Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN):

    - Most often middle age/older adults (peaks in 5th decade of life)

        arteries supplying neurons and skin)

- Kawasaki’s: not addressed here- most often children

<!-- -->

- Small Vessel Vasculitis (arterioles, capillaries, and venules)

<!-- -->

- ANCA-associated vasculitis:

<!-- -->

- GPA: granulomatous; classically involves nasopharynx, lungs, kidneys

- MPA: affects multiple organs but predilection for lungs and kidneys;
    > in contrast to GPA, no nasopharynx involvement or granulomas

- EGPA: granulomatous; predilection for heart and lungs; associated
    > with eosinophilia, chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma; uncommon \> 65
    > years old

<!-- -->

- Immune-complex vasculitis: not addressed here

    - Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (see lab section)

    - IgA vasculitis

    - Anti-GBM disease

Takayasu's Arteritis

Presentation

- Subacute constitutional symptoms (fevers, arthralgias, myalgias,
    rash, weight loss), limb claudication, neuro symptoms from
    carotid/vertebral arteritis (vertigo, headaches, syncope, strokes),
    GI symptoms from mesenteric ischemia, angina from coronary arteritis

- HTN (renal artery involvement), discrepant BP between arms (arterial
    stenosis), diminished or absent pulses (“pulseless disease”),
    arterial bruits, carotidynia (tenderness of carotid artery)

    Evaluation

- ESR/CRP (often elevated, though can be normal during active disease)

- Arteriography: MRA or CTA of head/neck, chest, and abdomen/pelvis

    Management

- New arterial stenosis or aorta/carotid artery involvement: 1mg/kg
    prednisone daily (max 60-80mg) for 2-4 weeks followed by steroid
    taper

- Organ threatening disease (coronary artery involvement, critical
    stenosis of carotid/vertebral arteries): 500-1000mg IV
    methylprednisolone daily for 1-3 days, then 1mg/kg prednisone daily
    for 2-4 weeks followed by steroid taper

Giant Cell Arteritis

Presentation

- Always consider in pts \>50 years old with new headache, abrupt
    vision changes (diplopia, amaurosis fugax), jaw claudication,
    temporal artery tenderness

- Polymyalgia rheumatica will often accompany GCA; classically with
    bilateral shoulder and hip pain/stiffness (with elevated ESR, but
    normal CK)

Evaluation

- ESR/CRP (almost always elevated), CK, TSH

- Evaluate for any temporal artery abnormalities (tenderness to
    palpation, presence of nodules)

- Ophthalmology evaluation if any concern for ocular involvement

- Temporal artery biopsy by vascular surgery

Management

- Start glucocorticoids as soon as GCA is suspected, do not delay
    while awaiting biopsy

    - No vision loss: prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max 60 mg) for 2-4
        > weeks followed by steroid taper

    - Vision loss/diplopia: 500-1000mg IV methylprednisolone daily for
        > 3 days, followed by prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max 60mg) for 2-4
        > weeks followed by steroid taper  

Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN)

Presentation

- Constitutional symptoms: fatigue, weakness, fevers, arthralgias,
    myalgias, rash, weight loss

- Evidence of multisystem involvement:

    - Asymmetric polyneuropathy with motor and sensory deficits (foot
        > drop, radial/ulnar neuropathy)

    - Skin manifestations: livedo reticularis, palpable purpura,
        > ulcers, tender erythematous nodules, bullae, vesicles

    - HTN (renal arteritis)

    - Abdominal pain and melena (mesenteric arteritis)

    - Ischemic cardiomyopathy (coronary arteritis)

    - Testicular pain (orchitis)

- Classically spares the lungs (consider other dx if pulmonary
    complaints)

Evaluation

- ESR/CRP, CK, TSH

- Hepatitis panel (HBV/HCV can cause secondary PAN)

- Arteriography: MRI, CT, or angiogram with classic “string of pearls”
    appearance 

- Biopsy: segmental transmural inflammation of muscular arteries,
    fibrinoid necrosis of arterial wall (no granulomas, presence
    suggests another process)

Management

- Mild disease (ex: isolated cutaneous disease): prednisone 1mg/kg
    daily (max 60-80mg) for 4 weeks followed by steroid taper

- Moderate disease: cyclophosphamide + prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max
    60-80mg) for 4 weeks followed by steroid taper

- Severe/life-threatening disease (renal failure, significant
    proteinuria, GI/cardiac/neurologic involvement): cyclophosphamide +
    500-1000mg IV methylprednisolone daily for 3 days, followed by
    prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max 60mg) for 4 weeks followed by steroid
    taper  

Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)

Presentation

- Constitutional symptoms (fevers, fatigue, weight loss) + evidence of
    glomerulonephritis (hematuria, proteinuria), upper respiratory tract
    involvement (nasal crusting, rhinorrhea, epistaxis, sinusitis), and
    pulmonary involvement (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis)

- Less commonly affects eyes (scleritis), skin (palpable purpura), and
    peripheral nerves (mononeuritis multiplex)

Evaluation

- ANCA + (typically PR3-cANCA)

- ESR/CRP, ANA, anti-GBM, C3/C4, cryoglobulins, HBV/HCV, HIV

- UA with microscopy (hematuria, proteinuria, RBC casts, dysmorphic
    RBCs)

- CT chest if pulmonary symptoms

- Biopsy: necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis, pauci-immune
    glomerulonephritis

- Clinical Pearl: If you suspect renal disease based (elevated Cr,
    hematuria) ask renal fellow or rheum fellow to help spin the urine
    to evaluate for RBC casting or dysmorphic cells. Quick way to
    confirm active GN, renal biopsy takes time to arrange

Management

- Mild-moderate disease: MTX + prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day followed by
    steroid taper

- Severe disease: rituximab or cyclophosphamide + prednisone
    1mg/kg/day (60-80mg max)

    - For pts with RPGN, pulmonary hemorrhage, mononeuritis multiplex,
        > or optic neuritis: IV methylprednisolone 7-15mg/kg/day (1000mg
        > max) x 3 days for induction therapy

- DVT ppx (high risk for DVT/PE)

Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA)

Presentation

- Similar to GPA, but without upper respiratory tract involvement;
    classically only involves lungs and kidneys

Evaluation

- ANCA + (typically MPO-pANCA)

- ESR/CRP, ANA, anti-GBM, C3/C4, cryoglobulins, HBV/HCV, HIV

- UA with microscopy (hematuria, proteinuria, RBC casts, dysmorphic
    RBCs)

- CT chest if pulmonary symptoms

- Biopsy: necrotizing vasculitis (no granulomas), pauci-immune
    glomerulonephritis

Management

- Same as GPA, see above

Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA)

Presentation

- Similar to GPA/MPA + atopic symptoms such as asthma (\>90%),
    rhinosinusitis, and peripheral eosinophilia

- Cardiac involvement (accounts for 50% deaths from EGPA): coronary
    arteritis, myocarditis, heart failure, arrhythmias

- Skin involvement (\>50%): tender subcutaneous nodules

Evaluation

- ANCA + (typically MPO-pANCA), peripheral eosinophilia

- IgE, ANA, RF, C3/C4

- Biopsy: necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis, eosinophilic
    infiltrates with fibrinoid necrosis, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis

Management

- Mild-moderate disease: prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg/day for 6-12 weeks
    followed by steroid taper

- Severe disease: cyclophosphamide + prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg/day for
    6-12 weeks followed by steroid taper

    - For pts with life-threatening multiorgan involvement (cardiac,
        > pulmonary, renal, neurologic): IV methylprednisolone 1000mg
        > daily x 3 days for induction therapy

- DVT ppx (high risk for DVT/PE)

Inflammatory Myopathies – Greg Jackson

Background

- Inflammation and damage of skeletal muscle primarily leading to
    weakness

- Subtypes: Dermatomyositis, polymyositis, antisynthetase antibody
    syndrome associated myositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myositis,
    inclusion body myositis

- Additional myopathies: statin-induced myopathy, metabolic
    (hypothyroid, electrolyte), viral/infection myositis, diabetic
    myonecrosis

- Important point: PMR= painful, preserved strength vs inflammatory
    myopathy = painless weakness

- Hypomyopathic (or amyopathic) variants: skin and/or lungs are
    affected \>\> muscles

Presentation

- Proximal, symmetric muscle weakness in upper and lower extremities
    in all but inclusion body myositis which is typically more distal
    and asymmetric

- Dermatomyositis: skin involvement can include heliotrope rash of
    upper eyelids, Gottron’s papules (on MCP, PIP), “mechanic’s hands,”
    and shawl sign

- Raynaud’s and arthralgias can also be present

Evaluation

- Labbs: BMP, TSH, CK level, anti Jo-1 antibody

- EMG: findings indicate myopathy

- MRI extremity/affected muscle group: muscle edema

- Skin biopsy in dermatomyositis: “interface dermatitis.”

- Muscle biopsy (do not do biopsy in same muscle as EMG done)

<!-- -->

- Polymyositis, inclusion body myositis: T cell mediated muscle injury

- Dermatomyositis: immune complex/B cell mediated muscle injury

Management

- Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 4-6 weeks with subsequent taper

- Consult Rheumatology

- MTX or AZA used if refractory to steroids, may need IVIG, rituximab

- If statin induced: stop statin or switch to lower intensity

- If dermatomyositis: evaluate for underlying malignancy

Arthrocentesis Quick Look – Raeann Whitney

When in doubt, tap it!

- Send synovial fluid for Gram stain/culture and cell count

- Beware: Inflammatory / crystal arthropathies can have very high
    leukocyte counts!

<!-- -->

- The presence of crystals does NOT exclude septic arthritis

<!-- -->

- A fever or concern for infection in a prosthetic joint is a surgical
    emergency; ortho will come in the middle of the night to tap a joint

- Contraindications to tap: overlying cellulitis or psoriatic plaque

<!-- -->

- Anticoagulation / DVT ppx is OK (no need to hold)

| ​Arthritis Type                  | Appearance ​          | Total WBC ​              | PMNs ​ |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| Non-inflammatory ​               | Straw like / yellow ​ | \<2000​                  | \<25%​ |
| Inflammatory / Crystalopathies ​ | Yellow / cloudy ​     | \>2000​ (often 20-50K+)  | \>50%​ |
| Septic ​                         | Purulent ​            | \>50,000​ (often \>100K) | \>75%​ |

Crystals

- Monosodium urate: needle-shaped, negatively birefringent

<!-- -->

- Sensitivity is generally good (\>90s%)

<!-- -->

- Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate: rhomboid-shaped, positively
    birefringent (weakly)

<!-- -->

- Weak birefringence significantly reduced sensitivity
