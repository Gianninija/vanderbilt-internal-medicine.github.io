# Systemic Lupus Erythematous 

Lale Ertuglu

---

## Background 
-	Characterized autoantibody formation to nuclear material and other cellular antigens, resulting in activation of complement and multisystem inflammation
-	More common in women, age of onset usually 16-55

## Presentation:
-	Constitutional: fatigue (most common complaint), fevers, myalgia, weight loss
-	Joints: arthralgias and arthritis (usually polyarticular, symmetric, migratory and nonerosive), Raynaud’s.
-	Mucocutaneous: malar rash, discoid skin lesions, photosensitivity, painless oral (usually palatal) ulcers, nasal ulcers, scarring alopecia from discoid lupus is specific (vs non-scarring diffuse alopecia which is common)
-	Cardiac: pericarditis (~25% of pts will develop at some point in disease course), verrucous (Libman-sacks) endocarditis, myocarditis, increased risk CAD
-	Hematologic: anemia of chronic disease (most common), leukopenia, ITP, AIHA
-	Renal: Lupus nephritis is the most common organ-threatening manifestation, can be refractory to therapy. Diagnosed and classified with renal biopsy.
-	Renal biopsy needed when Cr is rising, or there is persistent proteinuria or hematuria in UA
-	Class I and II are usually clinically silent. Class III and IV typically present as nephritic syndrome, class V mostly presents as nephrotic syndrome. Most patients present as an overlap (such as III + V or IV +V)
-	Pulmonary: pleuritis (if chronic may be complicated by shrinking lung syndrome), pleural effusion, ILD, pHTN
-	Neurologic: stroke, cerebritis, psychosis, mononeuritis multiplex
-	Ophtho: keratoconjunctivitis sicca (2/2 Sjogren’s syndrome)
-	GI: dysphagia due to esophageal dysmotility, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, elevation of LFTs (significant liver disease is rare)

## Evaluation
-	Labs: CBC, BMP, UA with sediment, Ur Pr:Cr ratio, inflammatory markers (nonspecific), ANA (high sensitivity), anti-dS DNA, anti-Smith, complement levels (C3 & C4 usually low)
-	Consider antiphospholipid antibody testing (lupus anticoagulant, anti-cardiolipin, anti- β2 glycoprotein)

## Management
-	HCQ is the first line treatment: 200-400mg/day (5mg/kg/d)
    -	Need retinal screening at baseline and annually after 5 years of therapy
    -	Not immunosuppressive
    -	Safe in pregnancy with improved pregnancy outcomes and reduced neonatal lupus
-	Glucocorticoids: ideally short-term. High doses may be used for life or organ threatening disease
-	Other therapies: MTX, MMF, AZA, RTX, belimumab, anifrolumab
-	Renal disease
    -	Immunosuppression: MMF, cyclophosphamide, belimumab, voclosporin – mostly used in combination with mycophenolate
    -	Renal protection: ACEi or ARB
