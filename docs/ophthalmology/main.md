Basic Eye Anatomy

- <u>Sclera</u> - White wall of the eye

- <u>Conjunctiva</u> - Translucent, vascularized tissue that covers
    the anterior sclera (bulbar conjunctiva) and lines the inner aspect
    of the eyelids (palpebral conjunctiva). When the eyes get “red,” it
    is usually the conjunctiva, and not the sclera, that is irritated
    (conjunctival vessels dilate).

- <u>Cornea</u> - Transparent, bubble-like structure in front of the
    eye.

- <u>Iris</u> - “colored” part of the eye that dilates and constricts
    the pupil to let in more or less light

- <u>Pupil</u> - the central hole in the iris

- <u>Anterior Chamber (AC)</u> - the space between the cornea and the
    iris

- <u>Aqueous Humor</u> - clear fluid that fills the anterior and
    posterior chambers, produced by the ciliary body. Nourishes the
    cornea. The balance of aqueous production and drainage dictates the
    intraocular pressure (IOP).

- <u>Iridocorneal angle (or just, the Angle)</u> - angle between the
    iris and the cornea and site of the Trabecular Meshwork, which
    drains aqueous humor from the anterior chamber into the ocular
    venous system.

- <u>Lens</u> - transparent structure located behind the iris that
    helps focus light onto the retina; also responsible for
    accommodation (focusing at near). Located behind the iris. A
    cataract is an opacification of the lens.

- <u>Ciliary body</u> - ring structure that sits behind the iris.
    Produces aqueous humor and suspends the Lens via filaments called
    Zonules.

- <u>Posterior chamber</u> - the space between the iris and the lens

- <u>Vitreous chamber</u> - the space between the lens and the retina

- <u>Vitreous humor</u> - thick, jelly-like transparent substance that
    fills the vitreous chamber

- <u>Retina</u> - tissue that lines the inner back wall of the eye,
    contains photoreceptors and interneurons that absorb light and
    convert it into visual electrochemical signals

- <u>Macula</u> - area of the retina responsible for central vision.
    The fovea is the center of the macula.

- <u>Choroid</u> - highly vascularized layer of tissue posterior to
    the retina

- <u>Optic disc</u> - head of the optic nerve; the optic nerve is
    composed of the axons of the retinal ganglion neurons, transmitting
    visual electrochemical signals from the retina to the brain.

- <u>Uvea</u> - iris + ciliary body + choroid. These 3 tissues are
    actually connected and collectively make up the vascular layer of
    the eye.

- <u>The Anterior segment</u> - all structures that make up the
    “front” of the eye, i.e., anterior to the vitreous chamber (cornea,
    iris, iridocorneal angle, lens, ciliary body, aqueous humor)

- <u>The Posterior segment</u> - all structures that make up the
    “back” of the eye, i.e., the vitreous chamber and all structures
    contained within it (vitreous humor, retina, choroid, optic nerve)

Taking a Good Ocular History

History of Present Illness:

- Duration/Onset/Timing of visual or eye symptoms

- Eye pain? Quality/Severity?

- Symptoms constant or intermittent?

- Has this happened to you before?

- Any flashes/floaters/curtains/veils coming down in your field of
    vision? Timing of these?

- Any associated systemic symptoms (nausea/vomiting, fever/chills,
    headaches, neurologic deficits)

Past Ocular History:

- Do you wear glasses? For distance or reading or both? Contact
    lenses?

- When was the last time you saw an eye doctor?

- History of eye surgeries?

- History of any other eye conditions? Cataracts, glaucoma, macular
    degeneration, diabetic retinopathy?

Family History:

- Family history of any eye diseases? Glaucoma, macular degeneration,
    diabetic retinopathy?

Social History:

- Use of tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs?

Approach to Blurry Vision

<img src="output/media/image18.png"
style="width:3.63889in;height:2.69212in"
alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated" />
Key Points:

- This flowchart is meant to serve as a guide. Bear in mind that there
    are always exceptions.

- Many ocular problems are not urgent and can be dealt with
    outpatient. Assessing the acuity of onset is the first step.

- In general, the top differential for blurry vision is Dry Eye,
    Cataract, or Uncorrected refractive error.

- If the symptoms are acute and just in one eye, it is more likely to
    be ocular and warrants further investigation (likely ophthalmology
    consult).

Approach to Double Vision (Diplopia)

<img src="output/media/image19.jpeg"
style="width:3.75in;height:1.18885in"
alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />

Key Points

- This flowchart is meant to serve as a guide. Bear in mind that there
    are always exceptions.

- Most important question to ask with any patient complaining of
    double vision is whether it goes away when covering one eye. If it
    does, then it is an ocular misalignment issue (= true binocular
    diplopia).

- If the diplopia is acute and constant, this requires more urgent
    evaluation than if intermittent.

- Look at the pupil and eye movements:

<!-- -->

- If the eye is dilated (“blown pupil”), abducted and infraducted
    (“down and out position”), and ptotic, this is classic for a
    complete CN3 palsy and requires immediate neuroimaging (e.g. CTA
    head) to rule out an enlarging aneurysm.

Approach to Flashes, Floaters, Spots

<img src="output/media/image20.jpeg"
style="width:3.74868in;height:1.86066in"
alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />Key Points

- This flowchart is meant to serve as a guide. Bear in mind that there
    are always exceptions.

- Scintillating or colorful lights/spots, especially if bilateral, are
    likely migrainous in nature.

- A patient may say they see a visual disturbance in the left eye,
    when in reality it is in the left visual field of both eyes
    (indicating that it is a neurological issue, e.g., migraine). Ask if
    the patient has tried closing one eye to see if the visual
    phenomenon is actually in one eye.

- Rapid onset of floaters, often preceded by a peripheral
    crescent-shaped light flash, is classic for posterior vitreous
    detachment. A black curtain or veil that comes down in the vision is
    classic for retinal detachment.

Approach to a Red Eye

When the conjunctiva is vasodilated, or “injected,” the eye looks red.
The more inflamed the conjunctiva, the angrier-looking the eye.

Differential for Red Eye:

- Dry Eye

<!-- -->

- Trace diffuse injection, blurry vision that fluctuates, gritty
    sensation, clears with blinking

<!-- -->

- Corneal abrasion / ulceration / exposure keratopathy

<!-- -->

- Unilateral, moderate to severe injection, may be diffuse or
    sectoral, pain, blurry vision, mucus discharge, history of poor
    blink rate, intubated/sedated status.

<!-- -->

- Subconjunctival hemorrhage

<!-- -->

- Patch of bright red, often with sharp borders. Due to rupture of
    conjunctival vessel. Whole conjunctiva can be involved and may be
    bright red. Looks scarier than it is. Common in patients on
    anticoagulation or after a Valsalva event (e.g., coughing). Will
    resolve spontaneously.

<!-- -->

- Allergic conjunctivitis

<!-- -->

- Chemosis, mild to moderate injection, blurry vision, very itchy,
    watery discharge, hx of allergies/atopy

<!-- -->

- Viral or Bacterial conjunctivitis

<!-- -->

- Moderate to severe injection, scattered subconjunctival hemorrhages
    or petechiae, itchy or burning/painful eyes. If viral, look for
    preauricular adenopathy or recent URI.

<!-- -->

- Acute angle closure glaucoma

<!-- -->

- Severe eye pain with nausea/vomiting, rock-hard eye, mid-dilated and
    fixed pupil, blurry vision

<!-- -->

- Uveitis/Episcleritis/Scleritis

<!-- -->

- Eye pain, perilimbal injection (“ciliary flush”), blurry vision, may
    have history of autoimmune disease. Episcleritis vs Scleritis can be
    difficult to discern. Scleritis may have a deeper, violaceous hue.

<!-- -->

- Endophthalmitis

<!-- -->

- Eye pain, history of trauma or eye surgery, severe vision loss,
    history of immunocompromise and systemic infection (if endogenous)

<!-- -->

- Carotid-cavernous fistula

<!-- -->

- Engorged and tortuous conjunctival vessels, recent history of
    trauma, resistance to retropulsion (pushing the globe back in)

Anisocoria

Background

- Anisocoria = unequal pupil size

- Constriction of the pupil is driven by parasympathetic innervation;
    Dilation by sympathetic innervation

- Physiological anisocoria = pupil sizes differ by \<1mm. Normal.

Conditions that can cause anisocoria:

- Benign episodic mydriasis

<!-- -->

- Intermittent episodes of pupillary dilation and possible association
    with migraine. No other significant neurologic or ocular symptoms
    present. Important to exclude other causes of mydriasis prior to
    this diagnosis.

<!-- -->

- Horner’s syndrome

<!-- -->

- Pupillary miosis + ipsilateral upper lid ptosis

- May be congenital or acquired

- Acquired causes include: trauma involving sympathetic pathway,
    carotid dissection, cavernous sinus pathology, stroke, neck or
    thoracic surgery, or Pancoast / mediastinal tumor (rare).

- If suspect new onset Horner’s, consider Neurology and Ophthalmology
    consult.

<!-- -->

- CN3 Palsy

<!-- -->

- Pupillary mydriasis (“blown pupil”) + adduction, supraduction,
    infraduction deficit, “down and out position”, upper lid ptosis.
    Must rule out a compressive lesion on CN3.

- If new onset, consider head imaging and Neurology and Ophthalmology
    consult

<!-- -->

- Medications (especially anticholinergics)

<!-- -->

- Commonly seen in young patients with scopolamine patches who forget
    to wash hands after handling the patch; dilation can last one day to
    a couple weeks.

<!-- -->

- Trauma

<!-- -->

- Damage to the iris sphincter after eye trauma can cause a dilated
    pupil that is poorly reactive to light.

<!-- -->

- Eye surgery

<!-- -->

- Patients who have undergone intraocular surgery (like cataract
    surgery) may have an irregularly shaped, less reactive, and slightly
    dilated pupil as compared to the other eye due to damage or
    stretching of the iris during the operation.

<!-- -->

- Infections

<!-- -->

- Viral infections and syphilis can cause parasympathetic denervation,
    resulting in a relatively mydriatic pupil that is poorly reactive to
    light. However, the accommodative pupillary response (i.e.,
    constriction at focusing on an object at near) may be intact.

- “Adie’s Tonic Pupil” = Idiopathic cause of parasympathetic
    denervation presenting similarly as above. However, viruses (HSV)
    are sometimes thought to be behind idiopathic cases.

<!-- -->

- Acute angle closure glaucoma

<!-- -->

- During an acute attack, the pupil may be mid-dilated and sluggish to
    light. However, patients will also have symptoms of acute angle
    closure (e.g., headaches, nausea/vomiting, eye pain, etc. See
    Glaucoma section for more info).

Conjunctivitis

Background and Presentation

- Allergic, viral, or bacterial cause

- All forms present with red and irritated conjunctiva

- In practice it can be difficult to distinguish between the types of
    conjunctivitis. However, these are rough guidelines:

<!-- -->

- Allergic: hx of allergies/atopy, bilateral, chemosis, watery/mucoid
    discharge, itchiness predominant symptom

- Viral: hx of recent URI or exposure, unilateral first then
    bilateral, itchy/burning, subconjunctival hemorrhages or petechiae,
    watery/mucoid discharge, tender preauricular lymph nodes

- Bacterial: itching less prominent, burning/aching/stabbing
    discomfort predominates, unilateral first then bilateral,
    mucoid/purulent discharge (and more copious)

<!-- -->

- Blurry vision is common, but loss of vision should not occur if
    disease limited to conjunctiva.

Management:

- Allergic: eliminate allergen, artificial tears,
    antihistamine/mast-cell stabilizer drops (olopatadine, ketotifen),
    oral antihistamine (diphenhydramine, loratadine)

- Viral: 4-8x/day artificial tears, cold compresses, isolation
    precautions.

- Bacterial: culture/swab the ocular discharge, isolation precautions,
    moxifloxacin drops (Vigamox) QID or trimethoprim/polymyxin B
    drops/ointment for 5-7 days

- Consult ophthalmology if concern for worsening

Corneal Abrasion, Exposure Keratopathy, Ulceration

Background

- Corneal abrasion = corneal epithelial defect (KED): an area of
    missing corneal epithelium. This is akin to a scratch on the skin.
    Most common causes include trauma, excessive surface dryness,
    infection, and neurotrophic disease

- Exposure keratopathy = development of corneal epithelial defects
    secondary to incomplete closure of the eyelids (i.e., prolonged
    exposure of the cornea to air). Most often occurs in patients who
    are intubated/sedated, have poor orbicularis tone/paralysis (Bell
    palsy), or have abnormal blink rate (e.g., Parkinson’s).

- Corneal ulceration = the injury extends past the corneal epithelium
    and ‘ulcerates’ into the underlying stroma. Ulcerations are often
    infectious and develop after untreated abrasions (abrasions are
    essentially open wounds). In rare cases ulcerations can also be
    sterile (autoimmune/inflammatory).

Presentation and Evaluation

- Abrasions and ulcerations are often extremely painful. May be
    exacerbated by blinking.

- Conjunctival injection; but sometimes the eye can appear normal, or
    only have trace redness, and the pain may seem out of proportion to
    external appearance.

- Mucus discharge /crusting

- Photophobia and tearing

- Blurry vision

- Ulcerations will present with the above, but also have a whitish
    infiltrate in the cornea. The conjunctival injection and discharge
    will often be a lot worse.

- 1 drop of Proparacaine 0.5% will improve pain

<!-- -->

- Note: Proparacaine is used only for diagnostic, and not therapeutic,
    purposes. Do not administer proparacaine on a scheduled or PRN basis
    for pain. The duration of action is only 15 minutes, and repeated
    chronic use can lead to corneal melt/ulceration.

<!-- -->

- 1 drop of Fluorescein followed by shining a blue light (or Wood’s
    lamp) will reveal the KED.

Management

- VUMC Perioperative Corneal Abrasion Protocol

<!-- -->

- If patient is recently postop, or underwent recent extubation, and
    presents with eye pain/burning, blurry vision, redness, photophobia,
    VUMC has a periop corneal abrasion protocol (do not place
    ophthalmology consult):

    - Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment TID into the lower fornix of
        eye x5 days

    - If the pain and redness do not improve within 48 hours, then
        consult ophthalmology

<!-- -->

- Corneal Abrasion

<!-- -->

- If patient’s signs and symptoms are consistent with a corneal
    abrasion, try erythromycin ophthalmic ointment TID as above.

- If the pain and redness do not improve within 48 hours, or have
    other concerns, consult ophthalmology

<!-- -->

- Exposure Keratopathy

<!-- -->

- If patient is intubated and sedated, or cannot otherwise fully close
    his/her eyes, take the following measures to prevent development of
    corneal abrasion or ulceration:

    - Moisture chambers (aka bubble shields) to eyes at all times

    - Copious amount of lubricating ophthalmic ointment (e.g.,
        Lubrifresh) in eyes TID

<!-- -->

- Corneal Ulceration

<!-- -->

- If you see whitish material in the cornea itself, this is likely a
    corneal ulceration and warrants an ophthalmology consult.

Cataracts

Background

- Opacification of the eye’s natural lens

- Primary cause is normal aging, occurs bilaterally and symmetrically

- Other causes include congenital, trauma, and medications (esp
    chronic / long-term steroid use

Presentation

- Most common symptoms include progressive decreased vision over
    years, increased glare, increased difficulty with night vision

Evaluation and Management

- Unless the cataracts are dense enough, it is difficult to appreciate
    without a slit lamp exam

- Please place an outpatient referral.

Dry Eye

Background

- Most common ocular complaint, especially amongst patients admitted
    to the hospital!

- Due to insufficient tear production and/or imbalance in the
    components that make up the tear film

- Etiology is vast and can include aging, eye strain/overuse, contact
    lens use, systemic and topical medications, post eye surgery,
    nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune disease, or concomitant with
    other ocular conditions.

Presentation

- Blurry vision bilaterally that comes and goes (very common–if the
    patient complains of fluctuating blurriness, Dry Eye should be at
    the top of your differential!)

- Excessive tearing /watery eyes

- Stinging, burning, soreness, discomfort, gritty/foreign body
    sensation

- Discomfort with eye movements

- Trace/mild conjunctival injection

Evaluation and Management

- If a patient's symptoms sound like Dry Eye, order some
    preservative-free (PF) artificial tears at least 4x/day and
    lubricating eye ointment at bedtime to see if the patient's symptoms
    improve.

<!-- -->

- Polyvinyl alcohol-povidone PF (Refresh Classic)

- Lubricating ophthalmic ointment (Lubrifresh)

<!-- -->

- Order them SCHEDULED. Do not order these eye drops PRN (patients
    will not ask for them).

- If a patient's symptoms fail to improve or worsen on artificial
    tears, consider paging ophthalmology for additional assistance. If
    there is no apparent imminent threat to vision, you can place an
    ophthalmology outpatient referral upon discharge.

Fungemia and Intraocular Involvement

The American Academy of Ophthalmology currently does NOT recommend
routine Ophthalmology consults for visually asymptomatic patients with
systemic candidemia. The incidence of candidemia-related endophthalmitis
detected from routine screenings is \<1%.

By contrast, if the patient has visual symptoms, an Ophthalmology
consult is warranted.

- Breazzano MP et al. American Academy of Ophthalmology
    Recommendations on Screening for Endogenous Candida Endophthalmitis.
    Ophthalmology. 2022 Jan;129(1):73-76.

Giant Cell Arteritis: Role of Ophthalmology

If a patient has systemic symptoms suspect of GCA (see “Rheumatology
section”), when is it appropriate to consult Ophthalmology?

- If patient HAS visual symptoms (acute vision loss, new onset
    diplopia), consult ophthalmology.

- If patient DOES NOT have visual symptoms, DO NOT consult
    ophthalmology (e.g., to rule out “retinal vasculitis.”)

- It is extremely unlikely that Ophthalmology will find a pertinent
    ocular finding in the absence of visual symptoms to support a
    diagnosis of GCA.

- Bottom line: If you suspect GCA given the other systemic symptoms
    (regardless of visual status), treat promptly with high dose
    steroids!

- Temporal Artery biopsies are typically performed by Vascular
    Surgery.

Glaucoma

Background

- Glaucoma is a disease of the optic nerve that follows a
    characteristic pattern of optic nerve fiber degeneration.

- High intraocular pressure (IOP) is believed to be the main etiology
    of the disease.

- While the “normal” IOP range is between 11 and 21 mmHg, there are
    individuals who have a pressure above 21 that do NOT develop
    glaucoma. Conversely, there are individuals who have a pressure in
    the normal range that DO develop glaucoma (= Normal Tension
    Glaucoma).

- Aqueous humor fills the anterior chamber and drains through a
    sieve-like structure called the trabecular meshwork (TM), located in
    the angle between the iris and the cornea. After passing through TM,
    aqueous drains into the eye’s venous system. Impediment to aqueous
    flow will cause elevated IOP.

Presentation

- All glaucomas generally cause progressive peripheral visual field
    loss that ultimately encroaches on central fixation and leads to
    irreversible blindness if left untreated.

- A glaucomatous optic nerve is often described as “cupped”

- Presents in an acute or chronic fashion:

<!-- -->

- Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma

    - The iridocorneal angle rapidly closes, blocking aqueous drainage
        and causing a sudden rise in IOP (usually \>40mmHg).

    - Symptoms and Signs: intense eye or orbital pain, headache,
        nausea/vomiting, blurred vision, halos around lights, fixed and
        mid-dilated pupil, rock-hard eye, conjunctival redness, cloudy
        cornea.

    - Usually unilateral, but occasionally can be bilateral.

    - Classic trigger is a pupil-dilating factor (e.g., dark
        environment or anticholinergic medications) in a person with
        anatomically narrow angles.

    - If IOP is not lowered within hours, permanent optic nerve damage
        and vision loss will likely occur.

- Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG)

    - The iridocorneal angle is open, but due to inadequately
        functioning TM (or other mechanism) aqueous does not drain
        properly and IOP is chronically elevated.

    - POAG is often painless and without noticeable vision changes in
        the early stage of disease. Individuals can go undiagnosed for
        years, sitting at an IOP of say 30mmHg, without being aware they
        are losing vision until the vision loss is severe.

    - POAG is the most common glaucoma in the US. When a patient says
        they have a history of glaucoma, they probably have POAG.

Evaluation and Management

- Primary Open Angle:

<!-- -->

- Continue the patient’s home glaucoma drops; caution if they develop
    a medical condition that results in a contraindication (See table
    below)

- No need to officially place an Ophthalmology consult to order a
    patient’s home glaucoma drops; feel free to page Ophthalmology if
    you have questions.

- Pro tip: Often patients will remember the cap color of the drops
    they take but not the names!

- Acute Angle Closure:

<!-- -->

- If suspect acute angle closure given the signs described above,
    consult Ophthalmology ASAP.

- The goal is to lower the IOP ASAP. Target is \<30mmHg.

- Administer frequent rotating rounds of all the IOP-lowering drops: 1
    drop of Cosopt (then wait 5 minutes), followed by Brimonidine (then
    wait 5 minutes), followed by Latanoprost (then wait 5 minutes)--then
    keep repeating the cycle until the IOP goes down.

- Concurrently, administer one dose of IV Diamox 500mg if not
    contraindicated (e.g., renal insufficiency or hepatic cirrhosis).
    Ophthalmology will recheck the IOP every hour or so to ensure that
    the IOP is responding (usually it does).

- If the IOP does not respond, patient will need a bedside AC tap to
    offload aqueous and lower the pressure.

- Patient should ultimately get a Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI) to
    avoid future angle-closure attacks, which is typically performed as
    an outpatient procedure.

Orbital vs Preseptal Cellulitis

Background

- The septum is a fibrous, membranous structure that divides the
    anterior from the posterior orbit.

- Preseptal cellulitis = infection is bound anterior to the septum

- Orbital cellulitis (AKA postseptal cellulitis) = infection extends
    posterior to the septum

- Common risk factors/etiologies: URI, acute or chronic sinusitis,
    trauma, tooth abscess, stye or other local/adjacent skin
    infection/condition, local/adjacent bug bite, immunocompromised
    state, underlying systemic infection

- Often bacterial cause (gram positive Staph or Strep species, and/or
    gram negative anaerobic species like Peptococcus or Bacteroides).
    Consider fungal infection (Aspergillus, Mucor) in immunocompromised
    or diabetic patients.

- Labs: CBC, CMP, ESR, CRP, blood cultures, wound culture if any open
    draining areas

- Imaging: CT orbits with and without contrast

- Daily or BID photographs to track progression

- You can use the LRINEC scale to help assess whether the infection is
    necrotizing:

- https://www.mdcalc.com/lrinec-score-necrotizing-soft-tissue-infection.
    Necrotizing soft tissue infections should be addressed immediately
    and undergo surgical debridement ASAP.

Management

- Preseptal cellulitis can usually be managed on an outpatient basis
    with PO antibiotics (e.g. augmentin) with close followup.

- However, if condition is worsening, if there is failure to improve
    on PO antibiotics, or if concerned for postseptal extension (i.e.,
    that the preseptal cellulitis has evolved into an orbital
    cellulitis), management generally includes:

<!-- -->

- IV broad spectrum antibiotics (usually Unasyn + Vancomycin to start
    if no intracranial extension; could also do Vancomycin +
    Ceftriaxone + Flagyl)

- Ophthalmology Consult

- Consider ID consult

- Consider ENT consult if concomitant sinus disease (most of the time
    there is)

- Consider OMFS consult if suspect etiology is odontogenic

- Tobradex eye drops QID to affected eye

- Nasal toilet (afrin, flonase, nasal saline)--usually dictated by ENT

- Warm compresses at least QID to affected eye

- Trend daily CRP

<!-- -->

- If there is failure to improve on the above regimen, a large orbital
    abscess, optic nerve stretch on CT scan, evidence of necrotizing
    infection, or visual compromise, the patient may need to undergo
    surgical drainage.

Optic Neuritis

Background

- Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve. Often caused by
    demyelinating disease (e.g., Multiple sclerosis). Less often, can be
    caused by infection (viral etiology, bartonella, Lyme, syphilis, TB,
    toxoplasmosis) or infiltrative process (e.g., sarcoidosis,
    malignancy).

Presentation

- Symptoms include scotoma, constant blurry vision or blurred spot,
    pain with eye movements, along with other systemic neurologic
    symptoms (if demyelinating process)

- If patient is of age 20s-40s and female, autoimmune/demyelinating
    disease is at top of the differential

- If patient is older, consider other causes

- If patient is immunocompromised, infectious etiology becomes more
    likely

Evaluation

- Consult both Ophthalmology and Neurology if concerned for an optic
    neuritis

- MRI brain and orbits with and without contrast, thin slices, fat
    suppression

- If no contraindications to imaging, obtain LP with CSF studies
    (glucose, protein, cell count, Gram stain, bacterial/viral cultures,
    RPR/VDRL, oligos, consider NMO/AQP4)

Management

- High dose IV methylprednisolone

- If vision continues to worsen and/or presence of other systemic
    neurologic symptoms despite steroid treatment, consider escalation
    to PLEX therapy with assistance of neurology

Papilledema

Background

- Papilledema refers to edema of the optic nerve due to increased
    intracranial pressure

- Ophthalmology is often consulted to rule out papilledema in patients
    who fit the “Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)” profile, or
    with patients with other reasons for high ICP

Presentation

- Symptoms of increased ICP: headaches that vary with position (often
    worse with bending over), nausea, vomiting, neck
    stiffness/meningismus, pulsatile tinnitus, fevers/chills

- Visual symptoms of papilledema: transient visual obscurations,
    dimming of vision, blurry vision, loss of color vision/red
    desaturation, loss of peripheral vision, scotoma.

Evaluation and Management

- Consult Ophthalmology and Neurology if concerned for papilledema.
    Neurosurgery should be involved if there is concern for shunt
    failure or other neurosurgical problem.

- Ophthalmology / Neurology will advise on what imaging to order
    (usually MRI / MRV brain with and without contrast, + MRI Orbits
    with and without contrast and fat suppression)

- If no contraindications after imaging, obtain LP with opening
    pressure, with CSF sent for cells, protein, glucose, and
    infectious/neoplastic workup where appropriate

- Ophthalmology / Neurology may recommend initiation of PO or IV
    acetazolamide (Diamox). These may be contraindicated or need to be
    renally dosed if the patient has chronic kidney disease.

Retinal Detachment and Posterior Vitreous Detachment

Background

- Retinal detachment (RD) = detachment of retinal tissue from the back
    of the eye. Risk factors include trauma, high myopia
    (nearsightedness), older age, history of RD in the other eye, prior
    eye surgery, and family history.

- Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) = detachment of vitreous (jelly)
    from the retina. PVDs eventually will happen to all adults as the
    vitreous liquefies and shrivels with age. Some are asymptomatic.

- PVDs can lead to RDs, but not always. As the vitreous peels away
    from the underlying retina, vitreous can pull a piece of retina with
    it, causing a retinal tear. The retinal tear, if not treated, can
    evolve into an RD.

Presentation and Evaluation

- Both can present with acute flashes and floaters

- However, RDs will often present with a black curtain or veil that
    comes down somewhere in the patient’s field of vision. PVDs may
    result in blurriness, but will not present with veils, scotomas, or
    severe loss of vision.

Management

- If patient presents with acute flashes, floaters, and/or black
    curtains in field of vision in one eye, consult ophthalmology.

- If not acute, or if symptoms occur in both eyes simultaneously,
    chances are this is not a PVD or an RD. See Approach to Flashes,
    Floaters, Spots.

Uveitis (includes Iritis, Cyclitis, Retinitis, Choroiditis)

Background

- ”Uvea” = iris + ciliary body + choroid (these 3 tissues are
    connected and make up the vascular layer of the eye)

- Uveitis = inflammation of either or all of these structures.
    However, “uveitis” is a bit of a misnomer, since it is used to
    denote inflammation of any ocular component

- Uveitis is usually associated with autoimmune conditions, but
    infections can also cause uveitis.

Management

- If you suspect a patient has uveitis, consult ophthalmology for
    evaluation.

- Patients with any of the above associated systemic conditions (e.g.,
    IBD) do not need an inpatient Ophthalmology consult unless the
    patient has visual symptoms. Referral to outpatient Ophthalmology is
    appropriate for routine screening.

Wilson’s Disease: Ophthalmic Manifestations

- The two classic ophthalmic manifestations of Wilson’s disease are
    the “Kayser-Fleischer ring” (copper deposition around the corneal
    limbus) and the “Sunflower cataract” (copper deposition in the
    lens).

- Wilson’s disease rarely affects vision (unless the sunflower
    cataract is very advanced).

- Unless the disease is very advanced/has been present for years, it
    is impossible for one to detect subtle copper deposition in the
    cornea, iridocorneal angle, or lens without an office-based slit
    lamp exam and gonioscopy (only available in the outpatient setting).

<!-- -->

- Furthermore, the presence or absence of a Kayser-Fleischer ring does
    not rule in or rule out the disease

- Testing for decreased ceruloplasmin, urinary copper levels, and
    genetic testing are more effective diagnostic methods.

<!-- -->

- If concerned about the visual impact of a developing sunflower
    cataract, an outpatient ophthalmology referral is appropriate.
