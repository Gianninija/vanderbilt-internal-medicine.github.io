4 M’s of Age-Friendly Care

Endorsed by the IHI to provide best evidence-based care to older
patients across all settings of care:

- What **M**atters Most: Understand each patients specific healthcare
    goals in the short and long term. Ask “what matters most” and align
    the care plan with what matters.

- **M**edication: Aim to reduce adverse drug events in the elderly by
    thorough med rec and avoiding potentially inappropriate medications
    (e.g. Beers Criteria) when possible

- **M**entation: Identify, treat, and manage dementia, depression, and
    delirium across various settings of care.

- **M**obility: Assess and optimize mobility

Physiological Changes with Aging

- **Cardiovascular**: Decreased vascular compliance and increased
    stiffness (intimal thickening). Decreased cardiac output. Maximum
    achievable HR decreases. Increase in systolic BP with decrease in
    diastolic BP (wider PP).

- **Endocrine/Immune:** Impairment of glucose tolerance (insulin
    resistance). Decreased sympathetic response to stress. Impairment of
    T-cell immunity and increased susceptibility to infection.

- **Gastrointestinal:** Decreased GI absorption, gastric emptying,
    motility, acid secretion, and hepatic blood flow. Reduced appetite
    and alterations of taste and smell.

- **Musculoskeletal:** Decreased bone density, muscle mass and
    strength. Increased fracture risk.

- **Neurologic:** Reduced cortical volume. Blunted vision, auditory
    function, and vibrotactile sensation. Decreased autonomic neural
    response. Slowed cognition and reflexes.

- **Pulmonary:** Increased chest wall rigidity. Decreased respiratory
    muscle strength. Decreased FEV1; FVC. Diminished ventilatory
    response to hypercapnia and hypoxia.

- **Renal:** Increased glomerulosclerosis. Decreased GFR and renal
    clearance of drugs/metabolites (↓ 1mL/min per year after age 40; Cr
    may stay the same due to reduced muscle mass). Reduced tubular
    function.

Dementia

Background

- **Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)**: short-term memory deficits prominent

- **Vascular Dementia**: “Stepwise decline” in memory and functional
    status

- **Lewy Body Dementia**: hallucinations, memory difficulties with
    atypical Parkinsonism early

- **Frontotemporal Dementia**: behavioral (aggressive or
    disinhibited), language (primary progressive aphasias) or memory
    (Alzheimer’s/FTD overlap) variants

- **Posterior Cortical Atrophy**: visual difficulties and ocular
    apraxia preceding memory problems

- **Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)**: manifests with subacute
    cognitive decline, seizures, vision loss, personality changes. Can
    develop startle myoclonus

- **Corticobasal degeneration**: focal neurologic changes with
    parkinsonism

- **Neurosyphilis**: rare, but treatable, present with a range of
    cognitive changes. Develop meningovascular encephalitis. Pts can
    develop an arteritis, headache, and hydrocephalus.

- **Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH)**: “wet, wacky and wobbly”
    meaning incontinence, gait apraxia and cognitive changes (usually
    frontal symptoms)

- **Autoimmune Dementias**: includes limbic encephalitis (like NMDA)
    where there are memory and personality changes, autonomic changes,
    hallucinations, and seizures

Evaluation

- MINI-COG: Screening test for cognitive impairment (highly sensitive)

<!-- -->

- Ask pt to remember three words (banana, sunrise, chair). Ask pt to
    repeat immediately

- Ask pt to draw clock. After numbers are on the face, ask pt to “set
    hands to 10 past 11”

    - Correct is all numbers in right position AND hands pointing to
        the 11 and the 2

- Ask pt to recall the three words

- MOCA: Montreal Cognitive Assessment

<!-- -->

- Lengthier test of cognition (but highly specific for cognitive
    impairment)

- Useful for detecting subtle deficits as in Mild Cognitive Impairment
    (MCI)

- Scores:

    - 18-25: Mild cognitive impairment

    - 10-17: Moderate cognitive impairment

    - \<10: Severe cognitive impairment

<!-- -->

- Rule out reversible causes of dementia-like symptoms: **DEMENTIA**

<!-- -->

- Drugs

- Emotional (depression)

- Metabolic (CHF, COPD, CKD, OSA)

- Endocrine (hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, hyponatremia)

- Nutrition (B12 deficiency)

- Trauma (chronic SDH)

- Infection

- Arterial (vascular)

<!-- -->

- B12, thyroid studies

- RPR, HIV testing in at-risk patient groups

<!-- -->

- Neuropsych testing can be done for more clear patterns of
    dysfunction

<!-- -->

- MRI brain with contrast if concerned for inflammatory or infectious
    causes

<!-- -->

- CJD: cortical ribboning on DWI with T2 hyperintensity in the
    thalamus and basal ganglia

- Sulcal crowding and bowing of the corpus callosum can be seen in NPH
    on imaging

Management

- Targeting Cognitive Impairment

<!-- -->

- Cholinesterase Inhibitors: Donepezil, rivastigmine

    - Indicated for any stage (except FTD)

    - SE: GI (nausea, diarrhea), bradycardia, orthostasis

- NMDA antagonists: Memantine

    - Indicated in moderate to severe AD in combination with
        cholinesterase inhibitors

    - Fewer SE than cholinergic medications

- Vitamin supplementation (i.e. Vitamin E)

    - Unclear benefit in delaying progression of dementia

<!-- -->

- Targeting Behaviors

<!-- -->

- Non-pharmacologic management has the best evidence of effectiveness

- Depression: Treat with antidepressants (SSRI’s)

- Sleep Disturbance: Mirtazapine (7.5 mg nightly) or Trazodone (25 mg
    nightly)

- Agitation: Try SSRI (citalopram, sertraline)

    - Consider antipsychotics (black box warning increased risk of
        death in elderly)

Malnutrition

Background

- Needs to meet two or more of following criteria:

<!-- -->

- Insufficient calorie intake

- Weight loss

- Loss of muscle mass

- Loss of subcutaneous fat

- Localized fluid accumulation that may mask weight loss

- Diminished functional status as measured in handgrip strength

<!-- -->

- Reversible causes of malnutrition:

<!-- -->

- Food security (poverty), dental status (dentition, gum health),
    dietary restrictions, food-related functional status (shop, prepare
    meals, feed self), depression, dementia, alcoholism, swallowing
    ability

Evaluation

- Assess for depression

- Screening with Mini Nutritional Assessment (good sensitivity and
    specificity)

- Order: CBC, CMP, TSH

- Nutritional deficiencies: B12, folate, vitamin D

- Consider CT C/A/P depending on history

- Refeeding: K, Phos, Mg BID until stable and no longer having to
    replete

Management

- Manage reversible causes of malnutrition as above

- Medications: consider Remeron (7.5 mg nightly). Avoid Megace (NNH =
    23 for death)

- Liberalize dietary restrictions

- Nutritional Supplementation: Oral enteral supplements (i.e.
    nutritional shakes)

Falls

Background

- Screen annually for falls in the past year

<!-- -->

- History of fall is a strong risk factor for future falls

- Recommended History Screening Tool: CDC STEADI Algorithm

<!-- -->

- Physical Exam Screening Tools:

<!-- -->

- If potentially unstable injuries (new spine fracture or lower
    extremity fracture): Ask ortho to clear the patient for mobility

- If no potentially unstable injuries, attempt to get the patient out
    of bed

    - If lying down, have them lift each leg off the bed

    - If they can do this, ask them to sit up on side of bed

    - If they can do this, ask them to stand

    - If they can do this without assistance, then observe them walk

- The Timed “up and Go” Test (TUG) tool for fall risk

    - Have the patient rise from sitting in a chair, walk 10 feet
        forward, turn around, walk back to chair, and sit down

    - Patients who require \> 10 seconds are at increased risk for
        falls

<!-- -->

- Med Rec:

<!-- -->

- Antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticholinergics, anxiolytics,
    sedatives/hypnotics, anti-hypertensives, antiarrhythmics, steroids,
    statins all can increase risk of falls

Management

- Rule out other causes: Cardiac, Neurologic, Infectious

- Check Vitamin D levels (goal \> 30) and supplement (800-1000 IU
    daily) if at increased fall risk

- Assess visual acuity (e.g. expedite cataract surgery)

- Hearing assessment (audiology screen)

- Consult Inpatient PT/OT and refer for HH PT/OT for home safety
    evaluation at discharge

- Recommend non-skid shoes with a backing (sneaker)

- Modify extrinsic risk factors for falls: removal of fall hazards,
    placement of handrails

- Referral to Exercise programs: At VUMC = Dayani Center “Ambulatory
    Referral to Medical Fitness” outpatient order

Functional Status

Background

- Functional status: Ability to perform activities necessary in daily
    life (ADL)

Evaluation

- Katz ADL scale, Lawton-Brody IADL scale, Get up and Go test, MMSE,
    Geriatric depression scale.

- Vulnerable Elders Scale-13: Identifies community dwelling pts at
    risk for decline over 5 yrs

- Functional decline is not normal with aging and warrants detailed
    physical, cognitive, and psychosocial evaluations

Frailty

Background

- Syndrome of physiological decline in late life, characterized by
    marked vulnerability to adverse health outcomes

    Evaluation

- FRAIL Scale Identifies frailty in community dwelling elders (1 -2 =
    prefrail; \> 3 = frail)

<!-- -->

- Fatigue: are you Fatigued more often than not?

- Resistance: are you able to climb a flight of stairs?

- Aerobic: are you bale to walk a block?

- Illness: Do you have more than five illnesses?

- Loss: Have you lost more than 5% of weight in 6 months?

<!-- -->

- Order Vitamin D and B-12 Levels.

    Management

<!-- -->

- Adapt interventions to the individual, incorporating patient
    preferences and stage on the spectrum of frailty

- Exercise programs with additional physical and occupational therapy
    input if indicated.

- Optimize nutrition via supplementation (Vit D, B12)

- Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment; Outpatient PACE

Medication Management

- Medication Reconciliation Upon Admission

<!-- -->

- Evaluating for Polypharmacy – Beer’s Criteria

<!-- -->

- Pharmacologic changes in the elderly

<!-- -->

- Pharmacokinetic (PK): Decreased hepatic and renal clearance.
    Reduction in first pass metabolism. Drug distribution changes due to
    decreased TBW and lean body mass resulting in relative increase in
    fat.

- Pharmacodynamic (PD): Exaggerated responses to pharmacologic therapy
    (therapeutic and adverse effects).

<!-- -->

- Avoid Prescribing Defaults:

<!-- -->

- NSAIDs can lead to gastritis, which can lead to prescription of PPI

- Diuretics can lead to urinary incontinence, which can lead to
    prescription of oxybutynin

- HCTZ can lead to hyperuricemia which can lead to prescription of
    allopurinol
