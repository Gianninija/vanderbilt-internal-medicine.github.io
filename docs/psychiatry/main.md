Agitation Management – Jonathan Constant, Jonathan Smith

Background

- Agitation in the hospital result from discomfort, illness,
    medication effects or frustrations the patient is unable to
    meaningfully communicate

Presentation

- Impulsive aggression: spontaneous, explosive, reactive/reflexive,
    not pre-meditated

<!-- -->

- Delirium, psychosis, cognitive deficits, withdrawal/intoxication,
    pain, post-ictal

<!-- -->

- Instrumental aggression: pre-meditated, controlled, purposeful
    behaviors

<!-- -->

- Personality disorders, secondary gain, delusional thought

<!-- -->

- Differential diagnosis for aggression:

<!-- -->

- Psychoses: mania, depression, schizophrenia, delusional disorder

- Personality disorder: antisocial, borderline, paranoid, narcissistic

- Substance use disorder: alcohol, PCP, stimulants, cocaine,
    synthetics

- Delirium, dementia

- Frontal lobe syndromes (TBI, CVA, neoplasm, neurodegenerative
    process)

- Behavior/Developmental: Intermittent explosive, intellectual
    disability

Evaluation

- Examine (when calm) for source of pain, signs of infection,
    discomfort (ex: urinary retention or constipation), toxidromes

- Neurological exam for focal deficits, ataxia, nystagmus, tremor,
    rigidity, aphasias

- Review medication list and perform med reconciliation of home meds

- UDS + review of CSMD for evaluation of intoxication/withdrawal

- CBC, CMP, UA

- CT head + EEG if focal neurologic deficits

Management

- Environment

<!-- -->

- Periodic room searches; search personal belongings, VUPD presence if
    warranted

- Virtual or 1:1 sitter placement,

- Delirium precautions (see delirium section)

- Disposable trays and utensils (minimize potential weapons in the
    room)

<!-- -->

- De-escalation: Always first line, although impractical if pt is
    unable to communicate effectively, is explosive or already engaging
    in violent/potentially harmful behavior

<!-- -->

- Nonverbal:

    - Maintain safe distance, avoid sudden movements, don't touch the
        pt

    - Maintain neutral posture, neutral, sincere eye contact, same
        height

- Verbal:

    - Speak in calm, clear tone, avoid confrontation, and offer to
        solve problem if possible

    - Do not insist on having the last word

<!-- -->

- Tactics

<!-- -->

- Redirection: Acknowledge pt's frustrations; shift focus on how to
    solve the problem

- Aligning goals: Emphasize common ground and big picture; make small
    concessions

- Know when to disengage/leave room

<!-- -->

- Restraints

<!-- -->

- Should be used only when necessary to protect patient or others from
    harm

    - Mechanically restrained patients cannot be left unmonitored

- De-escalate (4 point to 2 point, etc) and remove restraints as soon
    as possible

- Documentation of restraint:

    - Face-to-face assessment has to be completed within an hour of
        violent restraint

    - “Restraint Charting” tab – typically in rarely used tab drop
        down

- Mechanical Restraints:

    - Soft restraints – most commonly used

    - Hard restraints – reserved for severe behavioral health (only 2
        sets in house)

    - Mittens

    - Posey Vest – prevents exiting bed, allows limbs to be free

    - Posey Bed – wandering patient (TBI, severe dementia)

- VUMC Orders: “restraint” --\> order set

    - Non-violent non-self-destructive (order lasts up to 48 hrs)

        - Most pts needing restraint: non-psychiatric, delirium,
            dementia, intubation

    - Restraint violent self- destructive adult

        - Order lasts up to 24hr with assessment every 4 hours

        - Mainly severe psychiatric symptoms

Pharmacological Management for Agitation

As discussed above, behavioral interventions are first line for
agitation management in the hospital. Pharmacologic treatment should
only be used when needed for patient and/or staff safety when
non-pharmacologic interventions are unsuccessful or impractical

Acute Agitation

- Antipsychotics

<!-- -->

- Widely effective for acute agitation, especially in delirium and
    psychotic disorders

- Monitor EKG if repeated dosing or if used with other QT prolonging
    agents

- Moderate agitation options:

    - Olanzapine 2.5 - 5mg po q6h prn. Orally disintegrating tab (ODT)
        available

    - Quetiapine 12.5 - 25mg q6h po prn for patients at higher risk of
        extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)

- Severe agitation

    - Haldol 0.5 - 1mg IV/IM q6h prn for older/frail individuals

    - Haldol 2-3mg IV/IM q6h prn for other patients

    - Titrate up to 5 mg and can increase frequency as warranted

    - When using IV Haldol obtain daily EKG, Mg and K levels

    - Stop IV Haldol if QTc \> 500 msec

<!-- -->

- Benzodiazepines

<!-- -->

- Lacks EPS that can occur with antipsychotics but can worsen delirium
    & disinhibit patients with neurocognitive-related agitation

- Can use alone or in addition to antipsychotic agent

- Preferred for agitation related to intoxication/withdrawal of
    sedatives

    - Lorazepam preferentially used due to PO, IV and IM availability

    - Lorazepam 2mg PO/IM/IV q6h prn typical starting dose (1mg if
        older/frail)

        - Can increase frequency if warranted. Monitor for respiratory
            suppression

<!-- -->

- If severe agitation not responsive to above, may require sedation
    with infusion:

<!-- -->

- Dexmedetomidine, Propofol or Midazolam

Maintenance medications:

- Antipsychotics

<!-- -->

- Reserve antipsychotics for severe aggression that pose significant
    risk and aim to wean as soon as safely possible

- Adverse effects: metabolic, EPS, increased mortality in dementia

- Most commonly used: Olanzapine, Quetiapine, Risperidone

<!-- -->

- Antiepileptic agents

<!-- -->

- May be effective in reduction of impulsive aggression

- Most commonly used: Depakote

    - Levetiracetam could worsen aggression/agitation

<!-- -->

- Beta Blockers and Alpha Agonists

<!-- -->

- Noradrenergic over-activity implicated in aggression expression

- Commonly Used: Propranolol, Clonidine, Guanfacine

<!-- -->

- Serotonergic agents: SSRI/SNRI/buspirone

<!-- -->

- Useful if co-occurring depression/anxiety disorders

- Peak onset of action takes weeks

Medical Decision-Making Capacity – Chelsea Sprick, Neil Phillips,
Jonathan Smith

Background

- Capacity is a patient’s ability to make a specific medical decision
    at a specific point in time and can be assessed by any physician

- Competency: “global decision-making capacity,” a legal determination
    made by a judge

Four key components to assess medical decision-making capacity

1.  Choice: patient must clearly indicate a consistent choice

- “Have you decided whether to follow the recommendation for the
    treatment?”

- “Can you tell me what your decision is?”

2.  Understand: Patient must grasp the fundamental meaning of the
    > information communicated by the medical team

- “Please tell me in your own words what you were told about:

    - The problem with (1) your health now and (2) the recommended
        treatment

    - The risks/benefits of (3) treatment, (4) alternative treatments
        and (5) no treatment”

3.  Appreciate: the medical condition and likely consequences of
    > treatment options

- “What do you believe is wrong with your health now?”

- “What is treatment likely to do for you?”

- “What do you believe will happen if you’re not treated”

- “Why do you think this treatment was recommended?”

4.  Reason: patient must rationally manipulate relevant information

- “What makes the chosen option better than the alternative?”

- “How did you decide to accept or reject the recommended treatment?”

If the patient does not have medical decision-making capacity:

- Identify and remedy cause of impairment if possible (if decision is
    non-urgent)

- Identify surrogate decision maker

Documenting medical decision-making capacity:

- Use a dot phrase .Capacity that lists the four components and
    document your thought process citing evidence from your interview

Medical Holds – Soibhan Kelley, MD

Background

- 6401 vs. 6404

<!-- -->

- "6401": process to detain someone who has a high likelihood of
    posing harm to themselves or others *due to mental illness*. Purpose
    is short-term detention until a prompt psychiatric assessment can be
    performed

    - One person completes this. Can be law enforcement officers,
        psychologists, physicians

    - Must document justification for why the hold is needed (progress
        note, assessment form, etc)

- "6404": 6404= Certificate of Need. Legal document used for emergency
    involuntary psychiatric admission

    - Pt must have mental illness or serious emotional disturbance
        (excluding intellectual/developmental disabilities) and pose an
        immediate substantial likelihood of serious harm because of this
        based on a face-to face assessment by a qualified psychiatric
        professional

        - Treatment must be necessary for symptom reduction and lack
            of treatment would lead to deterioration, with no less
            drastic alternative to inpatient hospitalization

    - Two certificates needed: the first to transport a patient to a
        psychiatric facility and the second for an involuntary admission

    - Two different *qualified persons* must each complete a form

        - Psychiatry residents can write these due to their special
            training licenses

<!-- -->

- No AMA Medical Hold: used when a patient does not have capacity to
    leave the hospital against medical advice *due to a medical
    condition* and needs to remain in the hospital

<!-- -->

- Can be ordered by any physician Medical Hold Order Set

VUH specific procedures

- A physical copy of the first 6404 is required to accompany the
    patient when they are transported to a psychiatric facility after
    medical discharge. The form is completed by the psychiatry team

Inpatient Insomnia – Julian Raffoul, Jose Alberto Arriola Vigo

Background

- Sleep disturbances in the hospital are multifactorial

- Consequences of sleep disturbances include changes in cognition,
    behavior, anxiety, pain perception, respiratory function,
    inflammation, and metabolism

- Goals while inpatient: optimize sleep environment, minimize
    stimulating or sleep-related side effects of concomitant
    medications, utilize non-pharmacologic strategies

Management

- Non-pharmacologic interventions:

<!-- -->

- Noise reduction: (ear protection, white noise, etc.)

- Keeps lights on during the day and off at night

- Reducing nighttime interruptions: Retime VS checks and lab draws

- Minimize devices (ex: telemetry) and lines as able

<!-- -->

- Pharmacotherapy:

<!-- -->

- Minimize medications such as sedatives/hypnotics, opioids,
    glucocorticoids, beta blockers, and certain antibiotics that disturb
    sleep architecture

- Melatonin: 1-5 mg PO qhs

    - First-line choice based on mild side-effect profile, low
        potential for drug-drug interactions, and improves circadian
        rhythms; Dose 2-3hrs before bedtime

- Trazodone: 25-50 mg PO qhs (max 200 mg/day)

    - Side effects: headache, dry mouth, and nausea

    - Monitor for orthostasis and infrequent atrial arrhythmias; use
        lowest effective dose

- Mirtazapine: 7.5-15 mg PO qHS

    - A primary alpha-2 antagonist with 5-HT2 and H1 antagonism

    - Consider when insomnia appears to be related to primary
        depression

    - Can increase appetite and cause weight gain

Additional Information

- Avoid the following in the inpatient setting:

<!-- -->

- Benzodiazepines

    - Reduces sleep latency and increases total sleep time but avoided
        due to significant adverse effects: respiratory depression,
        cognitive decline, delirium, daytime sleepiness, and falls,
        particularly in hospitalized older adults

- Non-benzodiazepines benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g.,
    zolpidem, eszopiclone/zopiclone, zaleplon)

    - Commonly used in the outpatient setting but associated with
        cognitive dysfunction, delirium, and falls in hospitalized
        patients

- Diphenhydramine

    - Trials evaluating their effectiveness as sleep aids are limited
        and show mixed results

    - Many potential side effects that are enhanced in the inpatient
        setting: impaired cognition, anticholinergic effects
        (constipation, urinary retention)

Substance Use Disorder (SUD) – Barrington Hwang, Kristopher Kast

Background

- SUDs are common, complex, and chronic neuropsychiatric disorders
    with well-described inherited risk, dysregulated neurophysiology,
    and multiple effective treatment modalities

- Pts w/SUD face significant stigma, prior traumatic experiences in
    healthcare environments

<!-- -->

- Using the term “abuse” undermines the disease model of addiction

- Person-centered, specific terminology: “person with opioid and
    alcohol use disorders”

<!-- -->

- Avoid the qualifier “Polysubstance.” Instead, clarify specific
    diagnoses for each substance category

- DSM 5 Criteria (same for most substance categories): Requires 2+
    criteria met in past year; use must cause clinically significant
    impairment and/or distress:

<!-- -->

- Loss of control – larger amounts, longer time, ongoing use despite
    consequences, efforts/desire to reduce use

- Physiologic changes -- tolerance, withdrawal (these 2 alone do not
    necessarily imply a disorder if they result from prescribed
    therapy), craving

- Consequences – hazardous use, interpersonal problems, medical
    problems, failed role obligations, lost activities

General Management:

- First priority in the inpatient medical setting is to identify and
    stabilize withdrawal states

<!-- -->

- Mitigate risks of severe sequelae (seizure, delirium)

- Avoid unintended iatrogenic harm (ex: opioid abstinence leading to
    lost tolerance and post-discharge overdose)

- Avoid distress-driven AMA discharge

<!-- -->

- Consider Addiction Psychiatry consultation for management of complex
    withdrawal states, substance use disorders and co-occurring
    psychiatric diagnoses, assistance with risk stratification for
    hospital misuse and/or hospital discharge with PICC lines for
    outpatient antibiotics, and differentiation of pain requiring opioid
    therapy and opioid use disorder

- If in the emergency room and not admitted, consult PAS

Opioid Use Disorder – Rita Hurd, David Marcovitz

Background

- Standard of care is opioid stabilization with buprenorphine or
    methadone (in OUD) or other full agonist opioids (in chronic opioid
    therapy)

- Methadone and buprenorphine can be ordered by any physician for
    inpatients

- Maintenance agonist therapy should be offered to every patient, with
    preference for an “opt-out” approach (even for uninsured patients
    through state grant funding)

Presentation (Withdrawal)

- Restlessness/psychomotor activation, anxiety, irritability, nausea,
    abdominal cramping, loose stool, diffuse musculoskeletal pain,
    chills, insomnia, yawning

- Pupillary dilation, piloerection, tearing, nasal congestion,
    diaphoresis, restless legs

Evaluation

- Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS): quantifies severity of
    opioid withdrawal and allows for safer buprenorphine inductions

- Asking about opioid exposure: “You’re uncomfortable. I work with a
    lot of people in the hospital, and some come with regular exposure
    to opioids from a lot of different places (their doctors, friends),
    should we be treating any withdrawal for you?”

Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD)

Buprenorphine

- Partial agonist at the mu opioid receptor with high binding affinity

- Long half-life (24-36 hours) allows for daily dosing

- TID dosing is more effective for acute pain (as the analgesic effect
    is shorter-lived)

- OK to use in renal failure/HD; may reduce dose in hepatic injury

- All non-pregnant pts should receive buprenorphine-naloxone (e.g.
    Suboxone) formulations to mitigate risk of diversion/injection

- Induction:

<!-- -->

- Hold all opioid medication 12+ hours prior to first buprenorphine
    dose (typically, this opioid-free period is overnight from 9 PM to 9
    AM), with a recorded COWS score \>8-10;

- 4 mg is given SL, monitoring for oversedation; additional 4 mg is
    given in 1 hour, and final 4 mg at 4 hours (total of 12 mg in first
    day)

    - Only sedation or hypopnea should prevent a full 12 mg dose

- Typical starting dose: 12-16 mg/day

<!-- -->

- Maintenance: 4-32 mg daily; 16mg and above to suppress opioid use

<!-- -->

- Requires waivered-provider

<!-- -->

- Acute Pain Management in pts using Buprenorphine:

<!-- -->

- There is no contraindication to full-agonist opioid analgesia for
    breakthrough pain

    - If the etiology of pts pain would require opioid therapy in a
        non-OUD patient, do not avoid opioids; these may be used safely
        in the hospital

- Peri-operative pain management: continue buprenorphine at reduced
    and split doses (4 mg BID or TID); will prevent withdrawal and
    cravings, but NOT manage new pain

- Post-operatively: reduce opioid requirements and increase
    buprenorphine to home dose

    - If buprenorphine was discontinued, will require induction
        procedure

Methadone

- Full mu opioid agonist with additional NMDA-receptor activity

- Better option for individuals who cannot tolerate the buprenorphine
    induction procedure, with significant chronic or escalating pain

<!-- -->

- Long t1/2: 12-36 hrs; max 10 mg/d q7d, to prevent dose-stacking and
    delayed overdose

<!-- -->

- Safe in renal failure; dose reduction for hepatic injury

- Potential for QT prolongation at higher doses, warrants QTc
    monitoring

- Induction:

<!-- -->

- In the hospital, start at 10 mg TID, holding doses for sedation or
    hypopnea; lower doses if concerned for respiratory compromise or
    concurrent CNS depressant therapy

- Limit 40 mg in first 24 hours; then titrate 5 mg/d q3d while
    admitted

<!-- -->

- Maintenance:

<!-- -->

- Must confirm dose with methadone clinic before restarting outpatient
    dose; until then, do not give more than initial doses (30 mg in
    single dose, 40 mg in first 24 hours)

- After confirming home dose, continue as single daily dose

Naltrexone

- Mu opioid antagonist; Half-life oral \~4 hours but clinically active
    \~24 hrs

- IM maintains clinically effective levels up to 30 days

- High affinity for mu receptor --\> CAN precipitate withdrawal
    requiring 7-10 days opioid abstinence prior to initiation

- If due for monthly injection while admitted, may substitute oral
    formulation until discharged to outpatient provider to receive
    injection

Additional Information

- Psychosocial Interventions that complement MOUD:

<!-- -->

- Consider referral to SUD counseling, mutual help (self-help,
    12-step, AA), intensive outpatient, and short- or long-term
    residential treatment

<!-- -->

- Use of other drugs NOT a contraindication to MOUD, however should
    encourage abstinence from other drugs during therapy (especially
    benzodiazepines)

- Prescribe intranasal naloxone for overdose prevention to all OUD
    patients discharging from hospital, regardless of MOUD status

Alcohol Use Disorder – Barrington Hwang, Kristopher Kast

Background

- 50% of hospitalized pts drink alcohol; at-risk alcohol use is \>14
    drinks/week or \>5 drinks in a sitting (for men; for women and men
    \>65, 7 per week, \>4 per sitting)

- Alcohol withdrawal onset occurs 6-12 hours after last drink, with
    90% having non-severe course; CIWA score \<10 at 24-48 hours
    indicates low risk of worsening symptoms

- Risk of seizures greatest at 12-24 hrs, occurring in \~3% of pts;
    risk of delirium greatest at 48-72 hrs, occurring in \~5%

- Risk assessment

<!-- -->

- RF: prior seizures/delirium, co-substance use (especially
    benzodiazepines), no abstinent days in past month, presenting BAL
    \>200, dysautonomia

- CIWA symptom-triggered protocol appropriate for pts at low risk of
    severe withdrawal

- For non-low risk pts, consider benzodiazepine/barbiturate load and
    standing taper;

<!-- -->

- Indications for admission: prior severe withdrawal (withdrawal
    seizures or delirium), comorbidities (medical and psychiatric
    illness), pregnancy, significant impairment in social/occupational
    functioning, communication barriers, social barriers

Presentation

- Acute intoxication: disinhibition, slurred speech, ataxia, nystagmus

- Acute Withdrawal: nausea, vomiting, anxiety, agitation, audio-visual
    and tactile hallucinations, headache, diaphoresis, fine motor tremor
    while arms and fingers outstretched, autonomic hyperactivity

- Chronic heavy use: Sequelae of chronic liver disease & malnutrition,
    including thiamine deficiency

- Caine criteria for Wernicke’s encephalopathy:

<!-- -->

- 2 or more: (1) malnutrition, (2) ataxia, (3) oculomotor
    abnormalities, (4) AMS

Evaluation

- Identify last use, quantity per day/week, other sedative-hypnotic
    use, history of withdrawal, social/occupational dysfunction, other
    toxic forms of alcohol compounds including methanol, ethylene glycol

- Acute Alcohol Withdrawal

<!-- -->

- Labs: Blood alcohol level, urine toxicology (+/- ethyl glucuronide
    to detect use in prior 3 days), BMP, CBC, HFTs (AST:ALT elevation
    2:1), CK and β - hCG

- CIWA score quantifies severity, though subject to inflation by
    subjective symptoms

Management

Acute Alcohol Withdrawal

- Most patients are appropriate for diazepam-based protocols:

<!-- -->

- CIWA-based symptom-triggered for low-risk patients

- Diazepam load + standing taper for non-low risk patients

<!-- -->

- Substitute lorazepam for pts with hepatic impairment (risk of
    long-acting accumulation)

- Benzodiazepine resistance: likely due to poor cross-tolerance, these
    pts require phenobarbital load ( 8-12 mg/kg (up to 15 mg/kg) divided
    into 3 doses 3 hours apart)

- Add folate, multivitamin, and electrolyte repletion

- If \>2 Caine criteria, treat empirically for Wernicke’s
    encephalopathy with high-dose IV thiamine (500 mg TID IV x 3-5 days)

- Consider Addiction Psychiatry consultation for complex presentations

Alcohol Use Disorder

- After withdrawal stabilization, engage pt in discussion around use
    and educate on connection between use and presenting medical
    problems

- All patients with AUD should be initiated on pharmacotherapy (MAUD)
    prior to discharge to mitigate risk of relapse, if consistent with
    patient’s goals

- Additional psychosocial treatments effective for AUD include 12-step
    groups (AA, SMART Recovery), cognitive behavioral therapy, sober
    living facilities, family therapy, contingency management, and
    IOP/residential facilities

- If patient does not have abstinence goal, reduced or controlled
    drinking may allow for harm reduction; naltrexone and topiramate
    have evidence for non-abstinence outcomes

- Pharmacologic Interventions:

<!-- -->

- Naltrexone (cannot be on opioid agonist):

    - Need 7-10 days since last opioid before starting

    - 25 mg x1 day, then titrate up to 50 mg daily; also available in
        q30d IM

    - Monitor liver enzymes; AST/ALT must be \< 3-5x ULN

- Acamprosate (cannot be used in severe renal impairment)

    - Head-to-head, inferior to naltrexone (see COMBINE trial)

    - 333 mg TID, titrating to 666 mg TID dosing

- Disulfiram

    - Infrequently used outside of extreme motivation (e.g.
        professional under monitoring); would not use outside specialist
        care

    - Must abstain from alcohol \~2 weeks after last dose, given risk
        of disulfiram-ethanol reaction (DER), which can be fatal
        depending upon disulfiram and ethanol doses

- Topiramate

    - Not FDA-approved for AUD, but has significant supporting
        evidence

    - Useful for individuals without abstinence goal

    - Titrate slowly over 8 weeks to 200-300 mg/d

- Gabapentin

    - Not FDA-approved for AUD, but with some evidence

    - Useful for post-acute withdrawal anxiety, insomnia, or
        co-occurring neuropathy

    - Titrate to 900-1800 mg/d divided into TID dosing, monitoring for
        sedation

    - Risk of sedation/apnea if concomitant alcohol use

Delirium – Julian Raffoul, reviewed by Wesley Ely and Jo Ellen Wilson

Background

- Definition: acute fluctuating disturbance of attention and awareness
    due to an underlying medical condition

- Presentation: deficits in attention, orientation, or memory;
    hallucinations or delusions; sleep-wake disturbances; psychomotor
    changes (hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed); language impairment;
    and/or emotional lability (agitation)

<!-- -->

- Think about the ABC’s of Delirium

    - Affect (anxiety, paranoia, irritability, apathy, mood shifts,
        personality changes)

    - Behavior (hallucinations, restlessness or agitation, psychomotor
        abnormalities, sleep disturbances)

    - Cognition (impaired memory, disorientation, disturbances in
        speech)

Evaluation

- Use screening tools to assess for delirium: Brief Confusion
    Assessment Method (bCAM). See critical care section for the ICU
    version, CAM-ICU

    <img src="output/media/image28.png"
    style="width:1.9635in;height:1.9635in"
    alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />

- Once delirium is diagnosed, evaluate for the underlying cause.
    Delirium has many etiologies and may occur alone or in combination
    (in \~10% of cases, no clear cause is found)

<!-- -->

- Mnemonic for common causes of delirium:

    - D- Drugs/toxins (use of benzodiazepines, opiates,
        anticholinergics, steroids, etc., withdrawal from ETOH, benzos,
        etc.)

    - E- Eyes/ears (sensory deficits)

    - L- Low perfusion states (MI, PE, heart failure, sepsis)

    - I- Infection

    - R- Retention (urine, stool)

    - I- Intracranial events (trauma, seizure, stroke, hemorrhage)

    - U- Undernutrition/dehydration

    - M- Metabolic, endocrine (Hypo or hyper Na, hyperCa, uremia,
        thyroid, hypoglycemia)

- See neurology chapter for approach and work-up to AMS in general

Management

- Treat underlying cause as above

- See critical care section for prevention in the ICU (ABCDEF bundle)

- Cognitive impairment or disorientation: provide clock, calendar, and
    appropriate lighting. Regular reorientation. Provide cues from a
    familiar environment (pictures, calls or visits from family members)

- Encourage mobilization

- Review medications, eliminate sedatives and anticholinergics as able
    (review agents on Beers Criteria medication list)

- Remove medical support devices as able (foley catheters, telemetry)

- Maintain normal sleep-wake cycle. Keep lights on in the day and
    avoid excessive naps

- Ensure adequate bowel regimen and hydration

- Assess for pain and treat appropriately

- Ensure hearing aids, glasses, and dentures are available

- Note on pharmacologic management: There is no pharmacologic
    intervention known to prevent or treat of delirium. Reserve for
    agitation impairing patient safety when non-pharmacologic
    interventions alone are unsuccessful. See agitation section for
    medication approach
