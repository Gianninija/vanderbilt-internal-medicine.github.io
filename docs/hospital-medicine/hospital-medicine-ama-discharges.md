# AMA Discharges

Christine Hamilton

---

- Patients who leave AMA are significantly more likely to have hospital
readmissions and have higher mortality rates. If paged from the bedside
about a patient requesting to leave AMA, call nurse back and then go
speak with the patient.

1.  Address patient concerns (i.e. pain control, substance withdrawal,
    fear/anxiety, financial strain, diet) to address reversible causes
    for contention.

2.  Determine capacity to leave: review risks of leaving and medical
    reasoning to stay (see Medical Decision-Making Capacity under
    "Psychiatry"). This discussion should be witnessed by nurse or
    charge nurse if possible. Provider and patient will need to sign AMA
    discharge form, which nurse can obtain.

3.  Send new medications to pharmacy and request hospital follow-up
    visits if patient leaves

4.  Sign discharge order. In the "discharge to" section select "left
    against medical advice" (for more detailed discharge instructions,
    see appendices)

5.  Clearly document in discharge summary that patient was informed
    about the risks of leaving, had the capacity to make the decision to
    leave, and left AMA.

    - \*Caveat: if patient at any point becomes threatening or you feel
    unsafe, allow them to leave or contact security
