# Transitions of Care: Tips for Safe Discharges

Christine Hamilton

---

- Discharge from hospital represents a period of vulnerability for patients. Medical errors (especially medication errors) following discharge are exceedingly common and can lead to adverse events

## On Admission:
- Admission checklist: verify PCP, primary specialty providers, social
    support, current living situation, and functional status at the time
    of admission
- Track any new meds, held/stopped meds, and med dose changes from the
    beginning
- Consult PT/OT early for anyone who you anticipate may need home
    health services or need to be discharged to any location besides
    home

## During hospitalization:
- Consider barriers to discharge daily and discuss on rounds
- Discuss barriers to discharge, anticipated discharge destination,
    and any other needs in huddle
- Track any incidental findings or things for PCP to follow-up (e.g.,
    incidental nodules on scans: use .vnincidental)
- Discuss expected discharge timing daily with patient and family if
    possible, to set expectations
## On discharge day:
- **Communicate with patient's outpatient team (e.g. PCP)**
    - Typically achieved through the discharge summary
        - Include a list of specific, actionable follow-up tasks and
        assign a responsible party. Place in easy-to-view spot at the
        top of the summary
            - E.g., Instead of writing "follow-up BMP after initiation of
            furosemide," write "PCP to check BMP in 2 weeks after
            initiation of furosemide"
            - Include any pending studies and appointments from hospital
            admission
        - All relevant parties should receive a copy of the discharge
        summary (see appendices section for mechanics of discharge process)
            - It is useful to send patient with a printed copy of the
            discharge summary if they will follow-up outside VUMC
    -   For high-risk discharges (poor health literacy, hx of being lost to
    follow-up, follow up outside VUMC), consider calling PCP's office to
    set follow-up
- **Complete an accurate and thorough medication reconciliation**
    - An accurate discharge medication list depends on having a complete admission medication reconciliation (utilize pharmacy consult!)
        - Three steps to medication reconciliation:
            - Verification: Performing a Best Possible Medication History
            - Clarification: Checking that medications and doses are appropriate
            - Reconciliation: Record all medication changes
        - Seek to use at least two sources of information
        - Keep a list of any held or changed medications in your hospital course. Medication changes can be lost when not communicated during team transitions
        - Review medication changes on rounds and with pharmacist on day of discharge (bonus points for day prior to discharge)
    - Highlight any significant medication changes on discharge summary
        - Can include as follow-up tasks if pertinent (ex: PCP to follow-up BP in 2 weeks. Losartan held on d/c due to AKI but anticipate need to reinitiate once Cr normalizes)
    - Be sure to communicate any changes with the patient and/or caregiver
- **Ensure that appropriate resources and follow-up appointments have been requested* (PT/OT, skilled or non-skilled nursing HH, PCP follow-up, etc.)**
- **Effectively communicate discharge plan to patient**
    - Discuss medication changes, tasks for patient to complete, follow-up appointments
        - Key points should also be written in the patient instructions box
        - Useful to include educational sheets in the AVS (searchable in discharge navigator)
        - Utilize the teach-back method to ensure your instructions were effectively communicated
- At VUMC we are fortunate to have the Discharge Care Center
    - Multidisciplinary team including nurses, social workers, care
    coordinators, and pharmacists
    - Phone number is included on discharge paperwork, and patients can
    contact them 24/7. The DCC also reaches out to patients through an
    automated system
