Telemetry – Ahmad Dbouk and Samuel Lazaroff

Background

- Many monitored pts do not have a true indication

<!-- -->

- Leads to alarm fatigue, unnecessary workups, and is expensive

<!-- -->

- Telemetry is not a substitute for more frequent vital signs

- Discuss frequently on rounds: always reassess need and indication

- Stable patients without troponin elevation or new arrythmias are
    typically appropriate for transfers without telemetry

Notable non-indications:

- PCI for non-ACS indication (i.e. pre-transplant), non-cardiac chest
    pain, pt with AICD admitted for non-cardiac condition, non-cardiac
    surgery, chronic rate-controlled AFib

- Contraindicated in hospice/comfort care

- Nearly all noncardiac conditions (i.e., undifferentiated sepsis,
    stable GI bleed, alcohol withdrawal) upon transfer out of ICU

Lines and Catheters – Ahmad Dbouk and Samuel Lazaroff

Foley Catheter

- Indications: urinary retention, close urine output monitoring in
    critical illness or renal failure, need for strict I&Os (ex:
    diuresis) and unable to be achieved without catheter, surgery, open
    sacral/perineal wounds with incontinence, patient comfort at end of
    life

<!-- -->

- Urinary incontinence alone is not an indication for foley catheter

<!-- -->

- Duration of use is biggest risk factor for CAUTI

<!-- -->

- Best way to prevent CAUTI is to avoid inappropriate placement

- Assess daily whether foley can be removed

<!-- -->

- Chronic Foleys generally should be exchanged at time of admission

- Any concern for catheter obstruction (particularly with blood clots)
    should prompt urgent urology consult for irrigation/intervention
    (typically after RN has attempted)

- Difficult foley placement

<!-- -->

- Make sure an attempt has been made with a Coudé catheter. This
    catheter has a curved tip that can be useful in patients with BPH

PICC

- Single lumen: long term Abx, stable IV access with intermittent
    draws

- Double lumen: special populations (ICU or chemo), TPN w/ lipids
    (incompatible with many IV medications)

- Risk factors for CLABSI/VTE: ↑↑duration, ↑↑number of lumens, left
    arm, lower extremity

- A note on midlines:

<!-- -->

- A midline is just a long PIV inserted into the deep veins in the
    arm, typically 6-15cm

    - For reference, when you place an US-guided IV, the “long” 18G
        needles at VUMC are 2.5 inches (\~6.4cm)

    - Not much benefit compared to US-guided IV. Useful for stable IV
        access for meds and fluids. Not a stable route for blood draws

G-Tube

- Troubleshooting: EGS consult for malposition/not functioning, wound
    consult for skin breakdown

- G-tube study: 30mL Gastrograffin via tube \[resident often must
    push\], and order KUB

Transitions of Care: Tips for Safe Discharges – Soibhan Kelley

Discharge from hospital represents a period of vulnerability for
patients. Medical errors (especially medication errors) following
discharge are exceedingly common and can lead to adverse events

At VUMC we are fortunate to have the Discharge Care Center

- Multidisciplinary team including nurses, social workers, care
    coordinators, and pharmacists

- Phone number is included on discharge paperwork and patients can
    contact them 24/7. The DCC also reaches out to patients through an
    automated system

How residents can promote safe discharges:

- **Communicate with patient’s outpatient team (i.e. PCP)**

<!-- -->

- Typically achieved through the discharge summary

    - Include a list of specific, actionable follow-up tasks and
        assign a responsible party. Place in easy-to-view spot at the
        top of the summary

        - Ex: Instead of writing “follow-up BMP after initiation of
            furosemide,” write “PCP to check BMP in 2 weeks after
            initiation of furosemide”

        - Include any pending studies and appointments from hospital
            admission

    - All relevant parties should receive a copy of the discharge
        summary (see appendices

        section for mechanics of discharge process)

        - It is useful to send patient with a printed copy of the
            discharge summary if they will follow-up outside VUMC

- For high-risk discharges (patients with poor health literacy, hx of
    being lost to follow-up, patients following up outside VUMC)
    consider calling PCP’s office to set follow-up

<!-- -->

- **Complete an accurate and thorough medication reconciliation**

<!-- -->

- An accurate discharge medication list depends on having a complete
    admission medication reconciliation (utilize pharmacy consult!)

    - Three steps to medication reconciliation:

        - Verification: Performing a Best Possible Medication History

        - Clarification: Checking that medications and doses are
            appropriate

        - Reconciliation: Record all medication changes

    - Seek to use at least two sources of information

    - Keep a list of any held or changed medications in your hospital
        course. Medication changes can be lost when not communicated
        during team transitions

    - Review medication changes on rounds and with pharmacist on day
        of discharge (bonus points for day prior to discharge)

- Highlight any significant medication changes on discharge summary

    - Can include as follow-up tasks if pertinent (ex: PCP to
        follow-up BP in 2 weeks. Losartan held on d/c due to AKI but
        anticipate need to reinitiate once Cr normalizes)

- Be sure to communicate any changes with the patient and/or caregiver

<!-- -->

- **Ensure that appropriate resources and follow-up appointments have
    been requested** (PT/OT, skilled or non-skilled nursing HH, PCP
    follow-up, etc.)

- **Effectively communicate discharge plan to patient**

<!-- -->

- Discuss medication changes, tasks for patient to complete, follow-up
    appointments

    - Key points should also be written in the patient instructions
        box

    - Useful to include educational sheets in the AVS (searchable in
        discharge navigator)

    - Utilize the teach-back method to ensure your instructions were
        effectively communicated

Enteral Nutrition – Soibhan Kelley

Indications for enteral feeding

- Patients with high nutritional risk who are unable to maintain their
    own intake

<!-- -->

- Guidelines recommend calculating nutritional risk based on validated
    scoring tool (ex: Malnutrition Screening Tool). This is usually
    completed by the nutrition team

- Recognize who would benefit from nutrition consult to assist with
    risk determination

    - Patients with \>5% weight loss in past 1-3 months or decreased
        oral intake coupled with increased metabolic demands due to
        medical illness or surgery

<!-- -->

- Patients with low nutritional risk may not need enteral feeding if
    it is anticipated they will resume intake in 5-7 days

- Critically ill patients: goal is early initiation of tube feeding
    (within 48 hours)

Contraindications to enteral nutrition

- Bowel obstruction or severe ileus

- Ischemic bowel

- Acute peritonitis

- Major gastrointestinal bleeding

- Intractable vomiting

- Significant hemodynamic instability

<!-- -->

- Patients who are not adequately volume resuscitated and have
    significant hemodynamic instability (i.e., have high pressor
    requirements) are thought to be at increased risk for bowel ischemia

    - Pressors in general are not a contraindication to tube feeds. Ok
        to start once pressors are down-trending or at a stable level

Initiating tube feeds

- Enteral access

<!-- -->

- Nasogastric or orogastric feeding tube in acute setting. See
    procedures section for tips on placement

- For most patients, enteral feeding is safe with gastric tube
    placement

    - Consider post-pyloric placement for patients with high
        aspiration risk, impaired gastric motility, or patients who have
        demonstrated intolerance with gastric feeding

- Consider percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement if
    anticipate enteral nutrition \>4 weeks

<!-- -->

- Choice of formula and rate

<!-- -->

- Place nutrition consult. RD will calculation caloric and protein
    needs to determine goal rate and formulation

- OK to start tube feeds prior to recommendations and adjust later,
    especially if recommendations will be delayed. It only takes a
    simple calculation to make a reasonable tube feeding plan

    - Use weight-based dosing for calorie requirements

        - Use 25-30 cal/kg (use ideal body weight for most patients,
            use actual weight for underweight patient) to estimate daily
            needs

    - Most common formula used at VUMC is Nutren 1.5 (1.5 cal/ml) or
        Novasource renal if significant renal impairment (2 cal/ml)

    - Patients may need additional free water (most tube feed formulas
        are comprised of 80-85% water but varies with type). Typically
        dose as bolus of free water every 4-6 hours.

        - May empirically try 250cc free water every 4 hours and
            monitor Na trends. May need more if already with a large
            fluid deficit (ex: hypernatremia) or if high volume losses

        - May use clinical calculators as below

- Calculate hourly rate based on daily calorie need and formula
    calorie density

    - Ex: Patient with IBW of 70Kg will need estimated 1,750 calories
        per day (70 x 25 cal/kg)

    - If using Nutren 1.5, this will equal 1,167 ml per day (1,750
        divided by 1.5 calories per ml). This would equal a goal rate of
        about 50ml per hour (rounded up) of Nutren 1.5

    - Resources for quick calculations:

        - Search for “tube feed cheat sheet” on google and will find
            reference tables on EMCrit.org that gives you rate per hour
            for different weights and formula types

        - Clincalc.com also has a useful enteral nutrition calculator

- Start initially at a low rate (such as 10 mL/hr) to assess
    tolerability and advance to goal

    - Advance quickly if no concern for refeeding syndrome (ex:
        increase by 10cc/hr q6h)

    - If risk for refeeding syndrome or other issues with
        tolerability, typically advance more slowly over several days

Potential Complications

- Aspiration

<!-- -->

- Recommendation to keep head of bed elevated at 30 to 45 degrees (low
    quality, mixed evidence). Consider risks of this positioning (ex:
    formation of pressure ulcers)

- Consider post-pyloric placement if issues with aspiration (low
    quality, mixed evidence)

<!-- -->

- Diarrhea or constipation

<!-- -->

- Consider wheat dextrin fiber supplement (low quality evidence) but
    discontinue if not associated with clinical improvement. Avoid less
    soluble fibers such as psyllium due to risk of clogging tube. Avoid
    in patients with reduced GI motility due to rare risk of bezoar
    formation

<!-- -->

- Hyperglycemia

<!-- -->

- See endocrine section for management

<!-- -->

- Refeeding syndrome

    Monitor q8 hour Mg, phos, K in high-risk patients (underweight,
    recent weight loss, prolonged poor intake) and advance to goal
    slowly

Guidelines for Pregnant Patients – Ahmad Dbouk and Samuel Lazaroff

Acute Cystitis

- Significantly increased prevalence in pregnancy

- Symptoms: dysuria (urgency/frequency common in pregnancy)

- Diagnosis: evidence of pyuria and \>103 cfu/ml (note, if neg would
    test for g/c)

- Treatment: Empiric with cephalexin, cefpodoxime,
    amoxicillin-clavulanate, fosfomycin. Nitrofurantoin ok in second or
    third trimester. Avoid Bactrim in first trimester and near term.
    Tailor based on culture results.

- Note that asymptomatic bacteriuria is treated in pregnancy (in
    contrast with general public). Same antibiotic choices as above

Pyelonephritis

- Symptoms: fever, flank pain, and nausea/vomiting, dysuria

- Diagnosis: clinical suspicion + pyuria and bacteriuria

- Treatment: IV antibiotics for 1st 24-48hrs; beta-lactams preferred

- Mild to moderate: ceftriaxone or cefepime

- Moderate to severe: piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem

Hyperemesis Gravidarum

- Presentation: Hormone mediated nausea/vomiting typically starting
    before 9wks GA

- Differential: gastroenteritis, hepatitis, biliary tract disease,
    obstruction, pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, ovarian
    torsion, DKA, hyperparathyroidism, migraines, preeclampsia

- Workup: BMP, mg, phos, LFTs, lipase (may be mildly elevated in HG),
    UA,

- Treatment:

<!-- -->

- First Line: Ginger, doxylamine (25mg PO q6), pyridoxine (20mg PO q6)

- Second Line: metoclopramide (10mg q6), Promethazine (12.5mg q6)

- Third Line: ondansetron (8mg q12hrs, after 1st trimester)

- Hydration: 1L LR on admission + banana bag q24hrs

Hypertension:

- Both gestational HTN and preeclampsia/HELLP are typically diagnosed
    \>20w GA

- Tx options: nifedipine, labetalol, methyldopa, hydral (2nd line),
    clonidine (2nd line)

- Avoid: ACEs, ARBs, MRAs, Nitroprusside

Diabetes

- Due to hormonal changes associated with pregnancy, pregnant patients
    are at higher risk for poor control and DKA

- Oral regimens are generally transitioned to insulin-based regimens.

GERD:

- 1st Line: Can use antacids; avoid sodium bicarbonate and magnesium
    trisilicate

- 2nd Line: Sucralfate 1g PO TID

- 3rd Line: Cimetidine 200mg (30min prior to eating)

Asthma

- Similar rescue and controller medications as in non-pregnant patient

- Would favor using LABA \> leukotriene receptor antagonists for
    additional therapy

Wounds − Adapted from Dr. Duggan’s Geriatrics Guide

To do when admitting a patient with wounds:

- Document ALL wounds that are present on admission. This affects
    reimbursement

- Use the Haiku app on your cell phone to document images of wounds in
    chart

- Wound Service hours are Monday through Friday, 6 AM - 2 PM

<!-- -->

- If there is an urgent/emergent wound need (i.e. needs surgical
    eval or management), consult the appropriate surgical service

- While awaiting consultation, initiate topical wound care orders
    (detailed below)

<!-- -->

- Consider contributing factors: nutritional, pressure-offloading
    equipment, wound supplies, PT/OT, home health nursing

Types of wounds

- Arterial wound - Calciphylaxis

- Venous leg wound - Fistula

- Diabetic foot wound - Abscess

- Vasculitis - Skin tear

- Pyoderma gangrenosum - Pressure injury

- Fungating lesion - Ischemic ulcers / gangrene

Vascular Wound Etiologies

- Arterial: located on distal ends of digits, shallow, well-defined
    borders, pale/necrotic wound bed, minimal exudate due to poor blood
    flow, cramping pain or a constant deep ache

- Diabetic: plantar surface of foot, callused wound margins; usually
    painless due to neuropathy

- Venous: located on medial malleolus or gravity dependent areas,
    irregular edges, ruddy red with yellow slough and copious exudate
