# CPRS

FYI, the Cerner transition has a goal completion date of 2028.

This is a *goal* completion date, and this is a project of the US Government.

CPRS skills are likely to be useful for a good while yet.

## Shortcuts

CPRS has a rather staggering amount of keyboard shortcuts.

The full list is available in this [pdf](http://www.va.gov/vdl/documents/Clinical/Comp_Patient_Recrd_Sys_(CPRS)/cprsguium.pdf).

## Remote Access

One of the best categories of quality-of-life improvements 
you can make for using CPRS remotely
is text expansion/macros.

On Windows, PhraseExpress is great. 
On Mac, aText is also great.

Set up an expansion to enter your passcode (123456) and hit "Enter."

I have it set to `,c`. (I have `,e` mapped to my Epic password).

This saves so much time and hassle. 
For example, to sign a note, 
I hit `Ctrl+Shift+g` to open the "Sign Note" dialog (this is a built-in CPRS shortcut),
then I tap `,c`, and the note is signed.

The VA made their own tool to do this,
called "CPRSBooster" (it's somewhere under the Star folder on every desktop).
It works.

## VistA

VistA is the (rather insane) software and database system that undergirds CPRS.
I get the sense that the deepest magicks rest in VistA, 
waiting for the intrepid explorer,
seeking the grail filled with 
automated data extraction and sane clinical workflows.

The documentation is scattered. 
[This](https://www.va.gov/vdl/) is one of the official sources.
I've only taken a cursory look, but it seems less technical and mostly snarky.

There's also a [wiki](http://www.vistapedia.com/index.php/Main_Page#VistApedia) devoted to VistA,
though it is not restricted to the official USGovt version
(since the software is federally mandated to be open source,
it has been forked and developed in several countries worldwide).

If you have been inducted into the cult of VistA,
and need an acolyte,
let me know.
I make pretty kickass chocolate chip cookies.
