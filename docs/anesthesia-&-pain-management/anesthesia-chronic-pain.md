# Chronic Pain

## Suboxone/Buprenorphine management
-   Can restart home regimen if they have taken their suboxone in the
    last 48 hours
-   Look at CSMD on EPIC to verify their home regimen
-   If re-initiation is needed, consult addiction psych
-   Important for patients taking suboxone to remain on the medication
-   If pain is an issue, continue their medication and consult either
    chronic pain or acute pain service and addiction psych
## Methadone management
-   Patients need to be evaluated by addiction psychology service for
    methadone recommendations while inpatient (often requires QTc
    monitoring)
-   Patients should be continued on home regimen
