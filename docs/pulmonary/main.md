Hypoxia – Henry Brems

Background

- Two major ways to measure oxygenation, which are similar but
    distinct:

- SpO2 or "pulse ox" - most common, measures the O2 saturation of Hgb
    at capillary level

    - \<95% is abnormal, but do not need supplemental O2 unless
        \<90-92% in most pts

- PaO2 - the partial pressure of oxygenation measured on an ABG

    - \<80 mmHg is abnormal

- The relationship between SpO2 and PaO2 is the classic S-shaped
    curve.

    - SpO2 of \<88% PaO2 begins to fall off dangerously fast

Evaluation

- Confirm true hypoxia with good pleth

- CXR

- Labs: CBC, BMP, BNP, troponin, ABG/VBG

- EKG

- TTE: obtain with bubble if shunt on ddx

- Lung US: B lines, lung sliding, effusions, consolidations
    (hepatization), diaphragm paralysis

- Chest CT without contrast for evaluation of lung parenchyma

- CTA chest if suspicion for PE (see PE section)

- Outpatient PFTs if suspected obstructive or restrictive disease

Management

- Should be directed at underlying cause

- If acutely decompensating, Duonebs, IV lasix, antibiotics depending
    on clinical picture

- Supplemental O2 for goal SpO2:

<!-- -->

- \>90-92% for most patients (There is generally no need to make SpO2
    100%)

- Between 88-92% for patients with chronic hypoxia from COPD (i.e., on
    home O2)

Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) – Peter Edmonds

Full PFTs include:

- Spirometry: FVC, FEV1, with or without bronchodilator

<!-- -->

- Patients with new shortness of breath, chronic cough, or upper
    airway obstruction

<!-- -->

- Plethysmography: TLC, RV

<!-- -->

- Evaluation of restrictive diseases (ILD, neuromuscular) or
    hyperinflation (COPD, asthma)

<!-- -->

- Diffusion (DLCO) can be added to plethysmography

- 'Full PFTs' = Spirometry + Plethysmography + DLCO

Tips for ordering:

- Initial diagnostic workup: Full PFTs with bronchodilator challenge

- Chronic Lung disease: Spirometry to track FEV1/FVC over time +/-
    DLCO to evaluate ILD

Interpretation:

- Distinguish between obstructive and restrictive disease

<!-- -->

- FEV1/FVC \< 0.7 indicates obstructive disease

    - Normal to increased FVC & TLC is consistent with isolated
        obstructive disease

- TLC \< 80% is diagnostic of restrictive disease

    - Reduced FVC is suggestive, but not diagnostic of restrictive
        disease

    - FEV1 commonly too but FEV1/FVC ratio is normal in isolated
        restrictive disease

- Decreased FEV1/FVC and TLC suggests a mixed obstructive and
    restrictive picture

<!-- -->

- Assess DLCO -- abnormal is \<75%

<!-- -->

- Decreased DLCO can help differentiate between causes of obstructive
    or restrictive PFTs

Causes of common abnormalities:

- Obstruction

<!-- -->

- Decreased DLCO: COPD, CF, bronchiectasis

- Normal DLCO: asthma, early stages of COPD or CF

    - Asthma: spirometry may be normal, +bronchodilator response (an
        increase in FEV1 by 12% and 200ml after bronchodilator),
        +methacholine challenge

- Though we use FEV1/FVC to diagnose, we track disease severity using
    FEV1

<!-- -->

- Restriction:

<!-- -->

- Decreased DLCO: ILD

- Normal DLCO: pleural disease, chest wall (obesity, scoliosis),
    neuromuscular disorders

<!-- -->

- Decreased DLCO: If PFTs otherwise normal consider pulmonary vascular
    disease, pulmonary edema, or mixed obstructive/restrictive disease
    (pseudo-normalization of PFTs)

Basics of Blood Gases – Lexi Haugh

Did you order an ABG or VBG?

- Need to assess oxygenation ABG

- Need to assess hypoventilation May use VBG. ABG if shock, severe
    hypercapnia

- pH VBG usually correlates with an ABG (venous pH is \~0.04 lower
    than arterial pH)

<!-- -->

- Less accurate in shock or severe acid-base disturbance

<!-- -->

- ABGs are obtained by respiratory both at VUMC and the VA

- VBGs can be ordered like other labs on the floor. Ran as point of
    care test (iSTAT) in the ICU

Assessing Oxygenation:

- A-a gradient = PAO2 (alveolar O2) – PaO2 (arterial O2)

<!-- -->

- PAO2 = FiO2 (Pbarom - PH2O) - PaCO2/R

    - FiO2 = 0.21 on room air otherwise obtain from ventilator

    - Pbarom = 760, PH2O = 47

    - R (respiratory quotient) = 0.8

    - PaCO2 = arterial CO2 measured on ABG

    - Normal A-a gradient = (Age +10)/4

- See hypoxia section for ddx of increased A-a gradient

Assessing Acid/Base Status and Ventilation:

- Look at the pH (normal = 7.35 – 7.45): pH \< 7.35 = acidosis; pH \>
    7.45 = alkalosis

- Look at the pCO2 (normal = 35-45 mmHg)

| Primary Disorder      | pH      | pCO2 |
|-----------------------|---------|------|
| Respiratory Acidosis  | \< 7.35 | \>45 |
| Respiratory Alkalosis | \> 7.45 | \<35 |
| Metabolic Acidosis    | \< 7.35 | \<45 |
| Metabolic Alkalosis   | \> 7.45 | \>35 |

- Is the primary disorder acute vs. chronic?

- Is the primary disorder appropriately compensated?

- If not appropriately compensated, what additional process is
    present?

Primary Respiratory Acidosis:

- Acute versus chronic

<!-- -->

- Acute respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia will often present with
    somnolence or AMS

- Similarly, if a PCO2 is 80, and the patient is talking to you, it is
    most likely chronic

<!-- -->

- Acute Causes: Decreased respiratory drive (opiates, intoxication),
    respiratory muscle weakness (i.e., myasthenia gravis)

- Chronic Causes: COPD, sleep apnea

Primary Respiratory Alkalosis

- Acute Causes: Mechanical ventilation, anxiety/panic attack, pain, PE

- Chronic Causes: Pregnancy, CNS disorder, hormones (thyroid,
    progesterone)

Compensation for primary respiratory disorders

|         | Respiratory Acidosis                         | Respiratory alkalosis                      |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Acute   | 10:1                                         | 10:2                                       |
| Chronic | 10:3.5                                       | 10:4                                       |
|         | For every ↑of 10 in pCO2, HCO3 ↑ by 1 or 3.5 | For every ↓ of 10 in pCO2 HCO3 ↓ by 2 or 4 |

Primary Metabolic Alkalosis

- Appropriate Respiratory Compensation?

<!-- -->

- Expected pCO2 = 0.7\*(HCO3) + 20 (+/-5)

<!-- -->

- Etiologies: Associated with high aldosterone (either appropriate or
    inappropriate)

<!-- -->

- Chloride Responsive = appropriate hyperaldosteronism, can usually be
    fixed with Cl administration/ volume resuscitation

    - Etiologies: Volume contraction i.e., vomiting, over-diuresis)

    - Urine Cl \<20

- Chloride Unresponsive = inappropriate hyperaldosteronism, cannot fix
    with NaCl administration/ volume resuscitation

    - Etiologies: Steroids, Cushing’s, Conn’s, RAS, CHF, cirrhosis

    - Urine Cl \>20

Primary Metabolic Acidosis: See nephrology section, “Metabolic Acidosis”

Interstitial Lung Disease – Pakinam Mekki

Background

- Heterogenous group of parenchymal lung diseases that involve
    scarring or fibrosis, affecting the lung interstitium, alveoli, and
    pulmonary capillaries

<!-- -->

- Leads to loss of lung volume and compliance and impaired gas
    exchange

Etiologies

- ILD is divided into primary (idiopathic) causes and secondary causes

- Idiopathic: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, eosinophilic pneumonia,
    idiopathic NSIP, organizing pneumonia, acute interstitial pneumonia,
    etc

- Secondary

<!-- -->

- Systemic:

    - Connective tissue disease: RA, Sjogrens, dermatomyositis,
        polymyositis SLE, MCTD, scleroderma

    - Granulomatous disease: sarcoidosis, TB

    - Vasculitis: granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic
        granulomatosis with polyangiitis, amyloidosis,
        lymphangioleiomyomatosis

- Exposure

    - Pneumoconiosis (inorganic) – exposure to coal mines, silica,
        asbestos, organic solvents, heavy metals, solder, hair dressing
        chemicals

    - Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (organic)- farm exposures, chicken
        coops, pesticide, stored grains, mold (ex: water damage in home,
        hot tubs)

    - Iatrogenic – amiodarone, immunotherapies, TKI, TNF-a inhibitors,
        nitrofurantoin, radiation

Evaluation

- Dry cough is the most common symptom of ILD. Productive coughs are
    uncharacteristic

- History:

<!-- -->

- Duration, timing, severity of respiratory symptoms

- Exposures – pets, occupation, residence, smoking, drugs, travel,
    hobbies, dust, hay, grass,

- Screen for autoimmune symptoms (arthritis, myalgia, rash, Raynaud’s
    phenomenon

- Screen for vasculitis symptoms: hematuria, hemoptysis, mononeuritis
    multiplex

- Medication history

- Family history – premature aging, myelodysplastic syndrome (most
    common familial IPF association with telomerase mutations)

<!-- -->

- Chest Imaging:

<!-- -->

- CXR – could find peripheral reticular opacities

- HRCT protocol is used for diagnosis: evaluates the lung parenchyma
    while pt is supine, prone, with inspiratory and expiratory cuts

- There are two morphologic features on HRCT

    - Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP): basilar predominant
        fibrosis, honey combing, and traction bronchiectasis. Minimal
        GGOs. Pattern seen in IPF.

    - Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP): Marked by subpleural
        sparing, increased reticular patterns, and mosaic attenuation
        due to air trapping. Minimal or absent honeycombing

<!-- -->

- Labs

<!-- -->

- Rule out infection: CBC, RVP, sputum Cx, Histo antigen, Blasto
    antigen, Aspergillus galactomannan, 1,3-β-D-Glucan, sputum GMS,
    consider NTM, HIV

- Rheumatologic workup: ANA w/ reflex ENA, ESR, CRP, CK, aldolase,
    consider full myositis panel, RF, anti-CCP

<!-- -->

- Bronchoscopy

<!-- -->

- BAL is not diagnostic ILD (except eosinophilic PNA), may be helpful
    to rule out infection

- Transbronchial biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis. Surgical
    lung biopsy may be helpful in cases where the clinical evaluation
    and imaging are not effective (uncommon)

<!-- -->

- Misc:

<!-- -->

- PFTs with 6-minute walk test (prognostic value)

- TTE to evaluate for pHTN

- SLP evaluation for indolent aspiration

Management

- Acute flare – all non- UIP = may respond to steroids. Consult
    rheumatology if CTD origin for further options.

- Chronic therapy

<!-- -->

- Consider tyrosine kinase inhibitor (nintedanib; INPULSIS trial) and
    antifibrotics (pirfenidone; ASCEND trial) – reduces FVC decline but
    no change in mortality

- There is increased mortality in IPF with azathioprine/pred/NAC
    (PANTHER-IPF); steroids are not indicated

- Immunosuppression for autoimmune related ILD

- Antigen avoidance for hypersensitivity pneumonitis

<!-- -->

- Consider lung transplant evaluation for severe disease

Acute Asthma Exacerbation – Stacy Blank

Presentation

- History of asthma or a history concerning for asthma

- Progressive worsening of symptoms: dyspnea, chest tightness,
    wheezing, and cough

- Physical exam with wheezing, poor air movement, tachypnea, increased
    work of breathing, hypoxemia

- Often use of peak flows is cited in the literature (PEF \<200 L/min
    or PEF \<50% predicted indicates severe obstruction, PEF \<70%
    predicted indicates moderate exacerbation)

<!-- -->

- May be useful although often does not change management acutely

Evaluation

- Generally aimed at ruling out causes for exacerbation and other
    diagnoses; these are not required but should be considered in pts
    being admitted for inpatient management:

<!-- -->

- EKG, trop, BNP, D-dimer to assess for cardiac cause (ACS, CHF, PE)

- CXR to rule out underlying process (PNA, PTX, atelectasis)

- ABG/VBG not routinely needed unless ill-appearing, tachypneic, or
    lethargic/altered

<!-- -->

- Dangerous signs and possible ICU if:

<!-- -->

- Tachypnea \>30 and/or significantly increased work-of-breathing

- Hypercapnia or even normocapnia (these pts are usually
    hyperventilating; a normal CO2 in a severe asthma exacerbation could
    indicate impending respiratory failure)

- Altered mental status

- Requiring continuous nebulizers

Management

- Continuous pulse ox with oxygen therapy to maintain O2 \>92 %

- Continuous albuterol nebulizer or Duonebs until able to space to
    q1h\>\>q2h, etc

- Steroids with dosing based on severity of illness (there is no data
    behind exact dosing of steroids).

<!-- -->

- Start with IV methylpred 125mg q6h in severe exacerbation/ICU
    patients

- Can start with oral prednisone 60mg q12h in less severe
    exacerbation/floor pts

- Plan to transition from IV to PO and then likely to send pt home to
    finish course of 40-60 mg pred daily for 5-7 days.

<!-- -->

- IV mag sulfate 4g over 20 minutes for severe exacerbation

- Keep pt NPO until off continuous nebs/respiratory effort is
    improved. Consider IV fluids with pt’s comorbidities (HFrEF, renal
    disease) vs. increased insensible losses with resp effort

- If pt is not responding to therapies, has worsening respiratory
    status, or blood gas concerning for respiratory acidosis needs ICU
    care for BiPAP vs mechanical ventilation

- Note: We do not start empiric antibiotics unless there is concern
    for bacterial infection

Prior to discharge:

- Ensure that pt is on appropriate controller medications (see
    outpatient management)

- Evaluate for causes of acute exacerbation to prevent future events
    (noncompliance, resp viruses, allergies, exposures, etc.)

COPD Exacerbation – Taylor Coston

Background

- Presentation: increased dyspnea, cough, and sputum production or
    purulence, diffuse wheezing, distant breath sounds, tachypnea,
    tachycardia

- Severe respiratory insufficiency: accessory muscle use, fragmented
    speech, inability to lie supine, profound diaphoresis, agitation,
    asynchrony between chest and abdominal wall with respiration,
    failure to improve with initial emergency treatment

- Impending respiratory arrest: Inability to maintain respiratory
    effort, cyanosis, hemodynamic instability, and depressed mental
    status

- Remember that patients with COPD can have other causes of
    respiratory distress including acute coronary syndrome,
    decompensated heart failure, PE, PNA, PTX, sepsis, acidosis

Evaluation

- Initial Assessment: ABCs

<!-- -->

- Airway/Breathing: Ensure patient is protecting airway

    - If obtunded or in severe respiratory distress intubation

    - BiPAP typically appropriate for severe COPD exacerbation unless
        contraindication (vomiting, obtundation, facial trauma)

        - BiPAP is ordered as IPAP and EPAP, 12/5 is often a good
            start

- Circulation

    - For hemodynamic instability immediate rapid sequence intubation.
        Pt’s can be hypotensive for a host of reasons (pneumothorax,
        sepsis, circulatory collapse from hypoxia and bradycardia, etc)

<!-- -->

- Subsequent Workup:

<!-- -->

- Continuous pulse oximetry, ABG/VBG, EKG, CXR, CBC, BMP, troponin,
    BNP, sputum cx, RPP, blood cultures if hemodynamically unstable

- Lung ultrasound to differentiate COPD from pulmonary edema when a pt
    presents with wheezing and respiratory failure (pulmonary edema will
    have B lines)

- Consider trigger: viral infection (70%), PNA, PE (have a high index
    of suspicion for PE)

Management

- Bronchodilators

<!-- -->

- Order “Respiratory Care Therapy Management Protocol” at VUMC

    - RT evaluates the pt and based on physical exam will give a
        duoneb. Continues to assess the pt and treats based on severity
        of the exacerbation

- If ordering bronchodilators individually:

    - Albuterol 2.5 mg diluted to 3 mL via nebulizer or 4 to 8
        inhalations from MDI every 4 hours while awake (RT) or more
        frequently if needed

    - Ipratropium 500 mcg via nebulizer, or 4-8 inhalations from MDI
        q4 hrs while awake

    - Can additionally order Duoneb (albuterol and ipratroprium) q4-6
        hours at VUMC

    - There is no respiratory order protocol at the VA, order
        individually as above

<!-- -->

- Steroids

<!-- -->

- For severe exacerbation give methylprednisolone 125 mg IV BID (or
    60mg IV q6h)

- For moderate to mild COPD exacerbations give prednisone 40mg PO
    daily for 5 days (including the initial IV dose if pt received one
    in the ER)

<!-- -->

- Antibiotics

<!-- -->

- For moderate to severe exacerbations

- Azithromycin (500mg x 1 then 250mg daily x 4 or 500mg daily x 3) or
    doxycycline 200 mg BID if concern for QT prolongation. Can consider
    respiratory fluroquinolone in certain high-risk patients but
    typically too broad

- Refer to Pneumonia in Infection Disease chapter if treating
    concomitant pneumonia

<!-- -->

- Discharge Planning:

<!-- -->

- Controller medications/inhalers (see COPD in Outpatient chapter)

    - Make sure any new inhalers are covered by insurance prior to
        discharge

    - Provide inhaler education and consider use of a spacer

- Vaccinations (influenza, COVID, pneumococcal)

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Exacerbation

Background

- Presentation: acute worsening of pulmonary symptoms such as
    new/increased cough, sputum production (or change in sputum
    quality), dyspnea. May have constitutional symptoms including
    fatigue, poor appetite

Evaluation

- “Cystic Fibrosis” Admission order set in epic is useful and contains
    most of the work-up and management listed below

- Labs: Sputum culture (specify CF culture), RPP

- CXR PA and lateral

- Always ask about coughing up blood and amount -- see 'Hemoptysis'
    section if present

Management

- All patients need a cystic fibrosis pulmonary consult (unless on
    Rogers Pulmonary if attending specializes in CF). FYI there is no
    fellow so don’t worry when you have to page an attending

- All CF pts are placed on contact precautions

- Antibiotics

<!-- -->

- Check CF notes, recent hospitalizations, culture data – MRSA, MSSA,
    and Pseudomonas are the most common

- If they were recently admitted and improved on that antibiotic
    regimen, it is usually a good empiric choice. CF team will
    ultimately guide regimen

- General coverage:

    - MRSA vancomycin (Bactrim or linezolid for allergies)

- Pseudomonas Penicillin class (cephalosporin, carbapenem, extended
    penicillin) AND aminoglycoside or Ciprofloxacin (double coverage)

- Be aware that the antibiotic doses are not the typical doses used
    for other indications. Use Epic Order Adult Cystic Fibrosis order
    set for Antibiotic/dosing (or consult with CF team, pharmacy)

- Continue tobramycin nebs (if on that month) and MWF Azithromycin
    unless otherwise contraindicated if they are on these therapies at
    home

<!-- -->

- Airway/sputum clearance

<!-- -->

- Albuterol nebs, pulmozyme (if on at home), hypertonic saline (if on
    at home), Vest, positive end expiratory pressure valve (PEP, ex:
    Flutter, Acapella), chest percussive devices (the wand) as last
    choice (not as effective)

<!-- -->

- CF modulators (e.g., ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elaxacaftor): continue if
    on at home, needs a non-formulary order so pt can use own supply;
    time with fat rich meal for absorption

- Nutrition/GI

<!-- -->

- Pancreatic enzymes (most pts are on them), order at bedside for pt
    administration

- Always continue ADEK vitamins

- Daily to 3 times a week weight checks

- Nutrition consult

DIOS - Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome

-  Acute obstruction (complete or incomplete) in ileocecum by
    inspissated intestinal contents. Presents with abdominal
    pain/distension, constipation, poor appetite, possibly vomiting
    often looks like mechanical obstruction

- Treat with Miralax and/or Golytely

- RARELY surgery, try medical management first

Pulmonary Hypertension – Pakinam Mekki

Background

- Symptoms: insidious dyspnea, exertional chest pain, orthopnea, PND,
    edema

- Exam: JVD, increased P2, split S2, RV heave, TR murmur,
    hepatomegaly, ascites, edema

- Signs of RV failure: low cardiac output (hypotension, renal failure,
    hepatic congestion), arrhythmias, refractory hypoxemia (R→L shunt),
    effusions (pericardial \> pleural) 

- WHO Groups and Causes: 

<!-- -->

- Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): obliteration of
    blood vessels in the lung 

    - Idiopathic, heritable 

    - Drugs/toxins (methamphetamine) 

    - Associated with CTD, HIV, portal HTN, congenital heart disease,
        schistosomiasis 

    - Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD), pulmonary capillary
        hemangiomatosis 

- Group 2: Left heart disease: back pressure and passive congestion 

    - HFrEF, HFpEF, valvular disease, LA stiffness 

- Group 3: Chronic lung disease: chronic hypoxemia, chronic pulmonary
    vasoconstriction 

    - COPD, ILD, OSA, chronic high-altitude, developmental lung
        disorders 

- Group 4: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) 

- Group 5: Multifactorial

    - Hematologic disorders, chronic hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis,
        pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, fibrosing
        mediastinitis, metabolic disorders 

Evaluation

- Most common reason for admission with a known diagnosis of pHTN is
    volume overload/RV failure and hypoxia

<!-- -->

- Consider etiology of decompensation: Progression of underlying
    disease, medication/dietary nonadherence, infection, arrhythmia,
    myocardial infarction/RV ischemia, shunting via opening a PFO as a
    release valve, pulmonary embolism

<!-- -->

- Consult pulmonary hypertension with any questions or assistance with
    workup

- Studies to consider ordering to determine etiology of pulmonary
    hypertension

<!-- -->

- Labs: BNP, liver enzymes, rheumatologic serologies (ANA w/ reflex
    ENA, RF/CCP, ANCA, Scl-70, Ro/LA)

- EKG: R-axis deviation, RBBB, increased P wave in lead II

- CXR: increased PA and R heart border, vascular pruning

- TTE w bubble: RVSP \>35-40, RV dilation and dysfunction, RA
    dilation, septal flattening, pericardial effusion, evaluate for L
    heart disease and shunt

- PFT (outpatient): isolated decrease in DLCO in group I PH, TLC \<
    50%, FEV/FVC \< 70%

- V/Q scan or CTA chest to evaluate for CTEPH

- 6-minute walk test is prognostic, can be used to monitor response to
    therapy

- +/- CT chest to evaluate for parenchymal lung disease

- +/- sleep study to evaluate for OSA

- Right heart catheterization (RHC) is the gold standard test for PH
    diagnosis and determines pre-vs post-capillary HTN (See RHC section
    in Cardiology)  

    - Nitric oxide challenge to assess for drug response

    - Fluid challenge with 500cc LR to assess left heart compliance

Poor Prognostic Indicators for pHTN

- NYHA Functional Class (FC III-IV) - 6-minute walk test \< 300

- AKI - Hyponatremia

- Low SBP (SBP \< 90) - CTD or liver disease as etiology

- Poor hemodynamics on RHC (RAP \> 20; cardiac index \< 2)

- TTE findings - TAPSE \< 1.8, pericardial effusion, severe RV
    dysfunction

Management

- Goal of hospitalization is to understand and optimize hemodynamics

- Overall goal- improve NYHA functional class, RV function, 6-minute
    walk test, quality of life

- General management: treat underlying cause, diuretics for right
    heart failure, goal SpO2\>90%

- PAH medicines: Consult pulmonary hypertension if considering
    starting of changing meds

- Oral treatments may be used as monotherapy or in combination 

<!-- -->

- Calcium-channel blockers → patients with + vasoreactive challenge 

- NO-cGMP enhancers: PDE5-inhibitors sildenafil or tadalafil,
    riociguat 

- Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs): Bosentan, macitenatan,
    ambrisentan –

- Prostacyclin analogs

    - Prostacyclin analogs increase cAMP-mediated pulmonary
        vasodilation. Side effects include jaw pain, flushing,
        arthralgia, diarrhea.

    - IV formulations are administered through a continuous pump.
        Never stop IV prostacyclins, even brief pauses can cause rebound
        vasoconstriction and death. In an emergency, can run temporarily
        through PIV

        - Epoprostenol: IV (Veletri) or inhaled (Flolan), half-life 4
            minutes.

        - Treprostinil: IV/subcutaneous/inhaled/PO, half-life 4 hours 

        - Iloprost: inhaled, half-life minutes 

        - Selexipag (Uptravi): PO, half-life hours 

<!-- -->

- Treatment based on NYHA functional classification: 

<!-- -->

- Class I: no treatment or monotherapy 

- Class II: monotherapy or combination oral therapy 

- Class III: combination oral therapy or prostacyclin 

- Class IV: prostacyclin +/- oral therapy 

<!-- -->

- Lung transplant for patients who are candidates and failing maximal
    medical therapy 

- VA ECMO can be used as bridge to medical therapy or lung transplant 

- Atrial septostomy- serves as “pop-off” valve and allows for
    decompression of failing RV; used as definitive palliative procedure
    or bridge to transplant 

Hemoptysis – Henry Brems

Background

- Distinguish between massive (\>600cc/24hr or \>100cc/hr) and
    non-massive hemoptysis. Can be difficult to quantify expectorated
    blood volume and volume that is retained in lungs

- Massive is potentially life-threatening due to impaired ventilation

- Remember UGIB (hematemesis) and nasopharyngeal bleeds can easily
    mimic hemoptysis

- Presentation based on source of bleed:

Evaluation

- Check for anticoagulation on med list

- Labs: CBC, BMP, Coags, UA (for hematuria), ABG (evaluate
    oxygenation), type and screen

<!-- -->

- Consider ANA, ANCA, Anti-GBM, sputum culture (bacteria, fungal,
    AFB), sputum cytology depending on clinical context

<!-- -->

- Imaging: CXR first (to evaluate etiology and to localize the source
    to a side). Chest CT depending on prior workup, severity of bleed,
    and stability of patient

- Bronchoscopy is sometimes indicated to localize bleeding source

Management

- Urgent evaluation if any hemodynamic compromise, hypoxia,
    hypercarbia, or respiratory distress

- Ensure a secure airway: massive hemoptysis may require intubation
    and MICU transfer

- Reverse underlying coagulopathy if present. Consider trending HCT

- If unilateral bleed, place bleeding lung down (i.e. if the source is
    left lung, place pt on left side) to prevent filling 'good' lung
    with blood (include this info in sign-out if known)

- Urgent pulmonary consult if clinical instability: Bronchoscopy is
    diagnostic and therapeutic

- Obtain CT Bronchial Artery Protocol if concern for bronchial artery
    source (especially in CF patients) so embolization can be planned

<!-- -->

- Order this at VUMC with a CTA Chest (NOT a CTA PE as that will be
    timed incorrectly) and include "bronchial artery protocol" in
    comments for the study

<!-- -->

- Consider IR consult for angiography as diagnostic and therapeutic
    option

<!-- -->

- Consult early if there is massive hemoptysis; If bronchoscopy is
    attempted but fails to stop the bleed, they can get to angiography
    fastest if IR has already been made aware

Pleural Effusions – Eddie Qian

Background

- There is a normal influx of fluid into the pleural space due to
    leaky capillary membranes and the pleural space’s negative pressure.
    This fluid is constantly reabsorbed by lymphatics. An imbalance in
    the system will result in accumulation.

- Some examples:

<!-- -->

- Increased influx: increased filtration from the capillaries from
    high intravascular hydrostatic pressure (i.e., heart failure, renal
    failure) or low intravascular oncotic pressure

- Other liquid entry into the pleural space through anatomic deficits:
    CSF, chyle, urine, blood, ascites (the diaphragm is naturally
    porous)

- Decreased efflux: obstruction of the parietal pleural stoma (from
    protein or cellular debris in exudative pleural effusions)

- Increased systemic venous pressure (lymphatic system drains into the
    systemic venous circulation so high venous pressure prevents
    lymphatics from draining appropriately)

Evaluation

- Imaging:

<!-- -->

- CXR: lateral decubitus position (if effusion moves with gravity,
    suggests free flowing)

- Ultrasound: assess size, location, loculations

- CT Chest with contrast (not always indicated; helpful to eval
    septations)

<!-- -->

- Thoracentesis (see Procedures section):

<!-- -->

- Will it change management?

- Pleural LDH, protein, cell count/diff, culture (don’t forget to
    order serum LDH & protein)

- Consider: pleural cytology, hematocrit, triglycerides, glucose,
    amylase

- If septated or empyema, consider pulm consult for chest tube

<!-- -->

- Interpretation of pleural studies:

<!-- -->

- Lights criteria: 1 of the following to be considered an exudative
    effusion

    - Pleural to serum protein ratio \> 0.5

    - Pleural to serum LDH ratio \> 0.6

    - Pleural LDH \> 2/3 upper limit of normal range of serum LDH

- Transudative: CHF exacerbation, hepatic hydrothorax, atelectasis
    (caused by increased intrapleural negative pressure),
    hypoalbuminemia, renal failure

- Exudative: infections (bacterial, TB, fungal), malignant,
    rheumatologic, PE

- Other tips:

    - Protein: \>5 think TB or malignancy, \< 0.5 think urine, CSF,
        peritoneal dialysate

    - Glucose: \< 60 think about malignancy, TB, or rheumatologic,
        less likely hemothorax or parapneumonic

    - Cell count/differential: polys represent an acute process,
        monocytes represent a chronic process, lymphocytes think about
        TB or malignancy, eosinophils think about air/blood, TB,
        malignancy, asbestos, drugs

<!-- -->

- Two separate processes may co-occur, and a transudate may mask an
    exudative effusion; if concerned for this and you have clinical
    stability, trial diuresis prior to thoracentesis

Lung Masses – Chandler Montgomery

Background

- Definitions: lesion \< 3 cm = pulmonary nodule. Lesion \> 3 cm =
    lung mass

<!-- -->

- Pulmonary nodules are common and often benign, but presence of lung
    mass (\>3cm) should prompt workup as chance of malignancy is high
    (\>50%)

- For nodules, refer to the Fleischner Society guidelines (incidental
    nodules) or Lung-RADS (detected on lung cancer screening) for
    surveillance/management recommendations

- Note that in TN, prior histoplasmosis is a very common cause of
    pulmonary nodules

<!-- -->

- Differential diagnosis:

<!-- -->

- Malignant:

    - Primary non-small cell lung cancer (NCSLC): adenocarcinoma,
        squamous cell (SCC), large cell carcinoma

    - Metastatic: commonly melanoma, sarcoma, colon, breast, renal,
        testicular

        - Often multiple nodules/masses (e.g., cannonball) 

    - Neuroendocrine: small cell lung cancer (SCLC), carcinoid, large
        cell neuroendocrine

- Infectious:

    - Granulomatous: TB, non-TB mycobacterium, endemic fungal (histo,
        blasto, coccidio)

        - May have component of calcification

    - Abscess: Staph aureus, Klebsiella, anaerobes, polymicrobial
        (aspiration)

    - Septic emboli, hydatid cyst, aspergilloma

- Other: hamartoma, AVM, pulmonary infarct, inflammatory nodule (GPA,
    RA), sarcoidosis

Evaluation

- History: smoking, cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain, weight
    loss, fevers, night sweats, hoarseness, bone pain, neuro deficits

<!-- -->

- Lung cancer should always be considered in a patient with smoking
    history & new cough or hemoptysis

<!-- -->

- Exam: cachexia, lymphadenopathy, bone pain, hepatomegaly, neuro
    deficits

- Imaging:

<!-- -->

- CXR has poor sensitivity for lung nodules, may show large mass or
    malignant effusion

- CT chest (with contrast if possible - better evaluation of
    mediastinum/LNs)

    - Review prior chest imaging to assess age and growth pattern of
        lesion(s)

    - Benign features: small (sub-centimeter), calcified, fat
        attenuation, stable over 2 years, multiple nodules

    - Concerning features: large, growth, spiculation, upper lobe
        location, thick-walled cavitation, mediastinal invasion

    - Location- adenocarcinoma often more peripheral, SCC often more
        central, SCLC associated with massive LAD, mediastinal invasion,
        large hilar masses

<!-- -->

- Look for paraneoplastic syndromes:

<!-- -->

- SCLC: SIADH, Lambert-Eaton, Cushing’s syndrome

- SCC: hypercalcemia (PTHrP)

- Dermatomyositis, polymyositis, hypertrophic osteoarthropathy

Staging/Diagnosis

- Imaging: CT chest (with contrast if possible)m CTAP w/contrast vs.
    PET/CT to assess for metastasis, consider MRI brain if clinical
    stage III or IV disease

- Biopsy: careful planning is key

<!-- -->

- For metastatic disease, obtain tissue from least invasive site

    - FNA or excision of palpable lymph node (cytology department,
        US-guided procedure, or EGS)

- If uncertain how to best obtain tissue, consult IR, interventional
    pulm, and/or oncology to discuss approach

    - Surgical Bx: Wedge resection/lobectomy often preferred if
        solitary nodule amenable to both diagnostic and therapeutic
        resection in good surgical candidate

    - Bronchoscopy with EBUS (endobronchial US) often used to obtain
        biopsy of mediastinal tissue or central/peri-bronchial lesion

    - Trans-thoracic needle aspiration (TTNA): peripheral lesions not
        amenable to bronchoscopy

Management

- Planning is complex, usually discussed at multidisciplinary tumor
    board

- NSCLC

<!-- -->

- Stage I/II: surgical resection +/- adjuvant chemotherapy

- Stage III: more complex requiring multidisciplinary approach

- Stage IV: chemo +/- targeted therapy depending on PD-L1 expression,
    presence of driver mutations for EGFR, ALK, ROS-1, BRAF, MET, RET,
    others

<!-- -->

- SCLC: usually widely metastatic at time of diagnosis, treated with
    systemic chemo/radiation

Inhaler Therapy – Patrick Barney

Inhaler therapy

- Current inhaler device delivery options

<!-- -->

- MDI – typical handheld inhaler

    - Pro is same dose of medicine each time you use them – if used
        correctly.

    - Con is that it requires coordination. Patient must be able to
        time 3-5s slow inhalation and 5-10s breath hold w/ release of
        medicine, can be helped w/ spacer.

- SMI – “soft mist inhaler,” handheld. Creates cloud of medicine that
    is inhaled without propellant.

    - Pros are more medicine gets into lungs than w/ MDI so lower dose
        can be used, does not require coordination.

- DPI - handheld inhaler, delivers medicine whenever patient breathes
    in through the device, requiring less coordination.

    - Pro is lack of need to coordinate breath; Con is inconsistent
        dose delivery.

<!-- -->

- Nebulizers

<!-- -->

- Saline

    - Hypertonic saline, NS, 3% and 7%. Can be used to thin secretions
        and produce deep cough in patients who need to expectorate as
        part of treatment. For CF, chronic tracheostomy, NM weakness. No
        evidence for benefit in COPD.

- Enzymatic Agents

    - Dornase alpha – Pulmozyme – “DNAse’ - enzyme that breaks down
        polymerized DNA in high concentrations in CF airways, indicated
        specifically for patients with CF

- Anticholinergics

    - COPD exacerbation, asthma exacerbation – bronchodilation and
        secretion inhibition in acute setting

    - Ipratropium (Atrovent) intermittent nebulizer or
        Ipratropium-albuterol (Duo-Neb) intermittent or continuous
        nebulizer

- Disulfide Disrupters

    - Sever disulfide bonds of glycoproteins in mucus, lowering its
        viscosity and making it more amenable to suction, expectoration

    - N-acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) - nebulized form available in “adult
        burn inhalation injury protocol” when search “mucomyst”

- Antibiotics

    - May be indicated in patients w/ CF, non-CF bronchiectasis, VAP
        as salvage therapy

    - Tobramycin – only nebulized antibiotic available at VUMC

Categories of inhaled medications

- Short-acting beta agonist (SABA): beta-2 agonism of bronchial smooth
    muscle to achieve bronchodilation; also decrease mast cell mediator
    release. Ex: albuterol, levalbuterol

- Long-acting beta agonist (LABA): - beta-2 agonists, same as SABAs
    but have lipophilic side chains that allow longer binding but also
    slow the onset of action. Ex: formoterol, salmeterol, olodaterol

- Long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA): - non-specific muscarinic
    receptor antagonists, leads to bronchodilation and reduced
    secretions. Ex: tiotropium, umeclidinium, glycopyrrolate

- Inahled corticosteroid (ICS): - suppress airway inflammation. Ex:
    budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone

VUMC Inpatient Options

- SABA : Albuterol (Proventil/Ventolin/Proair) - MDI, neb, continuous
    aerosol available

- SABA/SAMA: Ipratropium-albuterol (Duo-Neb) - neb and continuous neb
    available

- LABA – only available in combination w/ ICS. LABA/ICS:
    vilanterol-fluticasone (Breo Ellipta), salmeterol-fluticasone
    (Advair Diskus/HFA)

- LAMA: Tiotropium (Spiriva Respimat)

- ICS: Budesonide inhaler (Pulmicort) or neb, fluticasone furoate
    (Arnuity Ellipta)

Airway Clearance Therapy – Patrick Barney

- Indications

<!-- -->

- Cystic fibrosis, advanced COPD, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis,
    chronic neuromuscular weakness, prolonged ventilator-dependence

- Goal is to assist patients with removing/expectorating mucus from
    lungs to decrease risk of atelectasis, mucus plug, increased airway
    resistance, infection

<!-- -->

- Chest Physiotherapy (CPT)

<!-- -->

- Use: pathologies w/ retained secretions and mucous plugging (CF,
    bronchiectasis)

- RT helps patient go through sequence of positions aimed at
    “draining” each of the lobes of the lung by gravity. Sometimes
    combined with percussion.

- Finding in Epic: chest physiotherapy \> CPPD panel – will initiate
    RT bronchial hygiene protocol and order TID CPT

<!-- -->

- High Frequency Chest Wall Compression (HFCWC)

<!-- -->

- Use: pathologies w/ retained secretions (CF, bronchiectasis, chronic
    bronchitis) or mucociliary clearance problems (lung transplant)

- RT wraps patient in inflatable vest, compressor rapidly inflates and
    deflates vest to “break up” thickened mucus from airway wall so it
    can be suctioned or expectorated

- Finding in Epic: vest \> Facility List \> vest physiotherapy or vest
    physiotherapy for CF under Procedures

<!-- -->

- Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP)

<!-- -->

- Use: pathologies w/ retained secretions as discussed above

- Patient exhales against fixed or fluttering resistor that allows air
    to get behind mucus, helps move mucus from airway walls, and holds
    airways open longer for improved ventilation

- Trade names- Flutter, Acapella, AerobikA

- Finding in Epic: PEP \> Facility List \> PEP therapy panel or
    Oscillatory PEP therapy panel under Order Sets

    - Can also find in a supply closet on 8S and bring to patient, be
        sure to teach them how to use it

<!-- -->

- Cough Assist

<!-- -->

- Use: most effective in patients with neuromuscular weakness
    affecting diaphragmatic strength – muscular dystrophy, myasthenia
    gravis, spinal cord lesions, SMA

- Via mask or trach/vent connection – applies positive pressure to
    fill the lungs, then quickly switches to negative pressure to
    produce a high expiratory flow rate to simulate a cough that is
    intended to produce expectorant

- Finding in Epic: cough assist \> Facility List \> cough assist
    treatment panel under Order Sets

Chest Tubes – Pakinam Mekki

Background

- Nomenclature: Small bore chest tubes= Pigtail Catheters (Often 8-12
    Fr) placed via Seldinger technique. “Chest Tube” technically denotes
    a large bore, surgical thoracostomy tube (Often 24-40 Fr)

- Indications: Pneumothorax, hemothorax (more often surgical chest
    tubes), empyema, malignant effusion (patient specific), chylothorax,
    penetrating chest trauma

- Contraindications: No absolute contraindications. Relative
    contraindications include hepatic hydrothorax, large emphysematous
    blebs, and anticoagulation or coagulopathy

Procedure

- Consult pulmonology for patients who may need pigtail chest tube

- Placement and Sizing

<!-- -->

- The location and size of the chest tube is related to the pathology

    - Pneumothorax anterior near the apex of the lung in the 2nd
        intercostal space, midaxillary line

    - Fluid (water, pus, blood), posterior near the base of the lung
        (fifth or sixth intercostal space, midaxillary line

    - Hemothorax surgical chest tube is placed to prevent clot
        formation

<!-- -->

- Potential complications: Laceration of an intercostal vessel, organ
    perforation (lung, heart, diaphragm, intraabdominal), trauma of the
    intercostal neurovascular bundle, subcutaneous emphysema,
    pneumothorax, infection, re-expansion pulmonary edema.

<!-- -->

- Smaller size results in less tissue disruption but more likely to
    clog or kink

**Understanding the Atrium:** After the chest tube is placed, it is
connected to the Atrium which can be connected to the wall for suction.
(See Diagram below)

<img src="output/media/image29.png"
style="width:2.78846in;height:2.62167in"
alt="A picture containing text, electronics Description automatically generated" />

<u>(A) Dry suction control-</u> determines the level of suction out of
the chest tube and is set by the provider. It is important to note that
while the atrium is linked to the wall suction via suction port (F) the
level of wall suction is determined by (A)

<u>(B) Water seal chamber-</u> if the atrium is disconnected from the
wall suction, it is on “water seal” (i.e., to gravity). This allows for
the one-way flow of pleural space contents out of the chest.

<u>(C) Air leak monitor-</u> if air bubbles are present in the water
seal chamber, then that indicates the presence of air in the pleural
space. The presence of air is different from normal “tidaling,” within
the water seal and requires troubleshooting (see below). Tidaling is
normal; it is the movement with respiratory variation in water seal
chamber. The water should rise with inspiration and fall with
expiration.

<u>(D) Collection chamber-</u> drains the pleural fluid contents via the
chest tube.

<u>(E) Suction verification window</u>- will be orange if suction is on
and atrium is functioning appropriately

Troubleshooting

- Air leaks: If bubbles are present in the water seal chamber, this
    indicates air in the pleural space. This is an expected finding in a
    pneumothorax; over time, the air leak should disappear as the lung
    re-expands. This contrasts with normal tidaling present with
    respiratory variation

<!-- -->

- There are two major causes of air leaks:

    - Persistent air in the pleural space, seen in alveolar-pleural
        fistula or pneumothorax (new or old)

    - Leak in the chest tubing at its insertion site or in the tubing
        system. To identify the etiology of a new air leak, try clamping
        the chest tube at various points, obtain a CXR

<!-- -->

- Clogging: Would see debris in the collection chamber and lack of
    tidaling in the water seal camber

<!-- -->

- In patients with viscous fluid output (ex- empyema), important to
    flush the chest tube with normal saline flushes at least twice daily
    to prevent clogging

- For clog- try flushing 10cc of sterile saline toward the pt or
    “stripping” the chest tube by pressing the chest tube with your
    fingers and pulling towards the drainage system.

- May require tPA or dornase for fibrinolysis, discuss with team that
    placed the tube

Chest tube removal

- Generally, chest tubes are removed when there is \< 150cc of
    drainage in 24 hrs (if placed for pleural effusion)

- For pneumothorax, there is typically a step-wise approach to
    removal. The team that placed the chest tube will guide removal

<!-- -->

- Suctionwater seal +/- clamp trial. CXR obtain after each transition
    to monitor for reaccumulation

<!-- -->

- Chest tube should be removed while patient hums (to prevent
    inhalation during removal that could introduce air into pleural
    space). Pigtail catheters have to be “unlocked” prior to removal to
    release the pigtail

Home Oxygen Therapies – Mackenzie Samson

Summary of Medicare Part B Guidelines for Home Oxygen:

- Conditions for which oxygen therapy may be covered

<!-- -->

- Severe lung disease including COPD and ILD, CF, bronchiectasis,
    widespread neoplasms

- Hypoxia related symptoms or findings expected to improve with O2:
    pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, erythrocytosis, impaired
    cognition, nocturnal restlessness, morning headache

<!-- -->

- Qualifying Tests and Requirements:

<!-- -->

- Testing must be performed with a pt in chronic stable condition or
    within two days of discharge from an inpatient hospital stay (after
    treatment of acute exacerbating conditions)

- Criteria: Resting SpO2 ≤ 88% (or PaO2 <55) or SpO2 <88%
    with ambulation

    - Must be documented in chart

<!-- -->

- Special Considerations:

<!-- -->

- Medicare requires an additional walk on 4L/min showing desaturation
    if the patient needs a flow rate of 5L/min or higher

- Because of the risk of desaturation with exertion and the intrinsic
    error in the pulse ox (around 3%), patients with resting SpO2 ≤ 92%
    should have amb sats checked

- Patients with Raynaud’s or poor circulation may have inaccurate
    finger pulse oximeter readings. Consider using a head saturation
    monitor

<!-- -->

- VA Specific Guidance: Will need to document ambulatory saturations
    in notes as above. Call the Oxygen Clinic (number listed in all team
    rooms) and talk with your case manager

Summary of Medicare Part C Guidelines for Home Respiratory Assist
Devices i.e. CPAP/BiPAP:

- Restrictive thoracic disorders, covered if the following criteria
    are met:

<!-- -->

- Documentation of a neuromuscular disease/severe thoracic cage
    abnormality AND one of the following:

    - PaCO2 ≥ 45mmHg on ABG, performed while awake and on home O2
        requirement

    - Sleep oximetry demonstrates oxygen saturation ≤ 88% for ≥ 5
        minutes of nocturnal recording time performed while on home O2
        requirement

    - For a neuromuscular disease (only), either: Maximal inspiratory
        pressure \< 60cm H2O or forced vital capacity \< 50% predicted
        and COPD may not contribute significantly

<!-- -->

- Severe COPD, covered if the following criteria are met:

<!-- -->

- PaCO2 ≥ 52mmHg on ABG, performed while awake and on patient’s
    prescribed home O2

- Sleep oximetry demonstrates oxygen saturation ≤ 88% for ≥ 5 minutes
    of nocturnal recording time, performed while breathing oxygen at
    2LPM or patient’s prescribed FiO2 (whichever is higher). Also
    requires that OSA had been considered and ruled out (formal sleep
    testing not required)

<!-- -->

- Hypoventilation Syndrome: covered if criteria 1, 2, AND either 3 or
    4 are met:

<!-- -->

- PaCO2 ≥45 mm Hg on ABG, performed while awake and on home O2
    requirement, AND

- Spirometry shows an FEV1/FVC ≥ 70% AND

- ABG PaCO2, performed during sleep or immediately upon awakening that
    demonstrates worsening PaCO2 of ≥ 7mm Hg compared to the original
    result in criterion 1 OR

- A facility-based PSG or HST demonstrates oxygen saturation ≤ 88% for
    ≥ 5 minutes of nocturnal recording time that is not caused by
    obstructive upper airway events

<!-- -->

- OSA:

<!-- -->

- An initial screening for OSA in the hospital is nocturnal pulse
    oximetry. The distinct “saw-tooth” pattern representing intermittent
    hypoxia is suggestive of OSA, and a formal NPSG or home sleep test
    is recommended to evaluate for OSA.  This is done on an outpatient
    basis only once acute issues have fully resolved

- Home CPAP/BiPAP covered IF:

    - The diagnosis of central sleep apnea or complex sleep apnea and

    - Significant improvement of the sleep-associated hypoventilation
        occurs with the use of the device
