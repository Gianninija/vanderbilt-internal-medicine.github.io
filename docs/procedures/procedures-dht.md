# Dobhoff Tube

## Indications

- Enteral feeding and medication administration if unable to swallow

- DHT v NGT: DHT deliver meds and fluids, NGT provide suction to
    decompress (can also deliver meds/fluids); nurses place NGT,
    residents (and ICU nurses) place DHT qUh5AJ5uIZo

## Relative Contraindications

- Esophageal varices or strictures (most hepatologists say this is not
    a contra-indication, but discuss if recent bleed or recent banding)

- Other altered gastric anatomy that may prevent passage. (i.e.
    gastric bypass, esophageal hernias, tumors or other possible
    obstructions)

- SBO or ileus (use NGT instead for suction)

## Absolute Contraindications for blind approach

- Facial trauma, basilar skull fracture, pharyngeal or esophageal
    trauma

## Consent

- Common risks: malposition (lung -\> pneumothorax or pneumonia;
    pyriform sinus; coiling anywhere along tract); perforation anywhere
    along the tract; aspiration, nasal ulceration, esophagitis,
    gastritis, bleeding, vagal response, discomfort

## Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 10k, no specific INR
    guidelines

- Make sure DHT and bridle sizes correlate

- Measure expected advancement depth by measuring distance from tip of
    nose, around ear, and to xiphoid process

- Prior to placement, fasten the stylet in the fully-hubbed position
    to reduce bending and folding over of the weighted tip while
    advancing

- Apply anesthetic with lidocaine gel (order Lidocaine uro-jet) and
    nasal swab to reduce pt discomfort, reduce gag reflex, and assist
    with clearance of the nasal passages

- Consider fluoro-guided placement after 3 failed bedside attempts

- Post-pyloric placement

    - Consider in patients with high pulmonary aspiration risk, severe
        esophageal reflux/esophagitis, recurrent emesis, impaired gastric
        mobility, and pancreatitis

    - Refer for fluoro-guided post-pyloric advancement after 1 failed
        bedside attempt

## Procedural Considerations

- Have the patient sit upright with their head tilted toward the chest
    to encourage posterior oropharyngeal positioning of the DHT while
    advancing

- Tip: advance horizontally (nose tip to ear lobe), not angled up

- If pt can participate safely, have the patient swallow in
    conjunction with advancement; pt can suck on straw (with small sips
    of water if low aspiration risk) to utilize pharyngeal muscles to
    position DHT into esophagus

- Place bridle and dog-bone tape while at the bedside to reduce
    dislodgement

- Excessive coughing, difficulty phonating, or resistance may indicate
    tracheal placement; withdraw tube and re-attempt. Consider Duonebs
    to reduce bronchospasms

- Post-pyloric placement has been shown to be up to 90% successful
    with intermittent insufflation of 10-20cc of air \~every 10cm of
    advancement after 55cm to promote pylorus opening. IV Reglan or
    erythromycin may also help

- When placing bridle (recommend AFTER xray confirmation), keep
    alignment markers (marked on both probes) together so magnetic tips
    will align once past the nasal septum

- When placing the bridle, remove the green stylet housed within the
    white probe before retracting back and removing the white probe

## Post-procedural Considerations

- ALWAYS confirm position radiographically via KUB before medications
    are given!

- Insufflation of air and auscultation of bowel sounds over the
    gastric area can be reassuring of correct placement of DHT prior to
    taping/bridling and leaving the bedside

- Most mispositioned/coiled tubes have to be removed and re-attempted,
    but it is ok to advance or withdraw if Stylet is still in place.
    However, once removed, a stylet should not be re-introduced to a
    mispositioned/coiled tube due to risk of GI perforation

- In case of cranial placement, donâ€™t remove, consult NSGY

- De-clogging: Clog Zapper Kit (can type this into Epic directly);
    coca cola
