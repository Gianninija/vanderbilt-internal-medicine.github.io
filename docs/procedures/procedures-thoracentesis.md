## Indications

- New pleural effusion that has no obvious explanation (not attributed
    to HF alone) or concern for pleural space infection

- Any respiratory symptoms that would positively respond to large
    volume thoracentesis (>1L)

## Contraindications

- Skin infection at needle insertion site

- Large-volume thoracentesis in hepatic hydrothorax (tends to
    reaccumulate). Suspected unexpandable lung

## Consent

- Common risks (> 5%): coughing, fainting, PTX

- Rare risks (< 1%): hemothorax, re-expansion pulmonary edema,
    liver/spleen puncture

## Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts > 50k, INR < 2 (risk/benefit
    evaluation outside these)

- If loculations present on US, high risk, or any question about
    indication, refer to Pulm

- Labs (order before so nurse can print labels): cell count w/diff; BF
    culture, BF & serum LDH, BF & serum total protein; BF & serum Hct if
    bloody; cytology if c/f malignancy; consider triglycerides if
    concerned for chylothorax

## Procedural considerations

- US Probe: Cardiac (or Linear) to identify safe pocket (>2 cm)
    between lung and diaphragm (ask Interventional Pulm or IR if sample
    is needed of a smaller pocket)

- Kit: 6Fr Safe-T-Centesis kit

- Upright position is typically preferred; lateral to mid-scap/mid-ax.
    If patient unable to sit upright, refer to procedure team vs
    pulmonology

- Effusion size: if unable to tap above 9th rib, too small; CXR with
    costophrenic angle blunting should correlate to ~250-500mL

- Insert needle superior to rib to avoid neurovascular bundle (bundles
    run below)

- Stop if pt has any new/increased chest discomfort, aggressive
    unremitting cough, frank purulence or air on aspiration,
    lightheadedness, hypotension, or vagal response

- Stop fluid removal after 1.5 L of chronic pleural effusion to reduce
    re-expansion pulmonary edema

## Post-procedural considerations

- If needing cytology, send at least 60 â€“ 100cc

- Bleeding complication: STAT page Thoracic Surgery

- PTX: if pt stable & asymptomatic, supplemental O2 and repeat CXR in
    4hrs; if unstable/symptomatic STAT page to Thoracic Surgery

- Re-expansion pulmonary edema: persistent cough, frothy sputum.
    Diffuse GGO on side of thoracentesis. Supportive management (oxygen,
    monitor); most resolve in 24-48 hrs. If respiratory distress
    progresses, may need mechanical ventilation

- Documentation: Effusion US characteristics (anechoic, layering
    debris, septations), reason for ending procedure (stopped early due
    to chest discomfort, complication vs tapped dry), presence of lung
    sliding, if more than scant residual effusion remains post-procedure

- A routine chest radiograph after thoracentesis is no longer
    indicated for most asymptomatic, non-ventilated patients. Check lung
    slide with US in 2D and M-mode
