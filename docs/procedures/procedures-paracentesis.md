## Indications

- Diagnostic: Evaluation of new onset ascites or of known ascites with
    concern for SBP

- Therapeutic: tense ascites, refractory to diuretics, causing pt
    discomfort

## Relative Contraindications

- Significant bowel distension due to ileus or SBO, hemodynamic
    instability (due to large fluid shifts with LVP), DIC,
    infection/breakdown of skin overlying puncture site

## Consent

- Risks: abdominal wall hematoma (1%), hemoperitoneum, organ puncture
    / bowel perforation, infection, ascitic fluid leak

## Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 20k, INR \< 4 \* (note that
    cirrhosis complicates INR interpretation)

- If therapeutic, determine volume pt typically gets drained so you
    have enough bottles (tip: call service center to request bottles be
    sent to RN station if you can't find enough)

- Labs (order before so nurse can print off labels): cell count
    w/diff, BF culture, BF & serum albumin, total protein; cytology if
    c/f malignancy; BF/serum Hct if bloody

- Measure skin/subQ depth with US to help choose sufficiently long
    needle for diagnostic paras
    
## Procedural considerations - Paracentesis 

- Ultrasound Probe: curvilinear

- Identify safe pocket (\>2 cm deep), with no nearby bowel or
    adhesions

- Local anesthesia with lidocaine all the way to peritoneum, as this
    is most sensitive part

- Kit: 6 Fr Safe-T-Centesis Kit; gather cx bottles, cx bottle syringe
    adaptor, specimen cup

- If only diagnostic, use 18G needle with 20-50cc syringe rather than
    kit

- If high bleeding risk, use long 18G needle & attach to syringe
    instead of 6 Fr. Catheter

- Avoid surgical scars out of concern for nearby adhesions and
    superficial veins

- Attempt as lateral as possible to avoid inferior epigastric vessels

- Roll patient to left or right side to promote pooling of fluid for
    easier/safer access

- Inoculate culture bottles at bedside rather than sending fluid
    samples to lab for inoculation to increase yield 50% 80% (Note that
    VA does not allow bedside inoculation.)

- If hernia present, have patient reduce it while draining fluid to
    prevent incarceration

## Post-procedural considerations

- Albumin (25%) for large volume (\>5L fluid removal): give 8 g per
    liter removed, up to 50 g

- Ascitic leak: Can try skin glue or place 1 figure-of-eight stitch
    with 4.0 vicryl

- Bleeding complication: hold pressure with quick-clot and gauze for
    \>5-10 mins if persistent bleeding at site; if profuse bleeding or
    concern for organ injury, STAT page EGS and/or IR
