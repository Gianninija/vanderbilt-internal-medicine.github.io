- Diagnostic: Evaluation of new onset ascites or of known ascites with
    concern for SBP

- Therapeutic: tense ascites, refractory to diuretics, causing pt
    discomfort

## Relative Contraindications

- Significant bowel distension due to ileus or SBO, hemodynamic
    instability (due to large fluid shifts with LVP), DIC,
    infection/breakdown of skin overlying puncture site

## Consent

- Risks: abdominal wall hematoma (1%), hemoperitoneum, organ puncture
    / bowel perforation, infection, ascitic fluid leak

## Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 20k, INR \< 4 \* (note that
    cirrhosis complicates INR interpretation)

- If therapeutic, determine volume pt typically gets drained so you
    have enough bottles (tip: call service center to request bottles be
    sent to RN station if you can't find enough)

- Labs (order before so nurse can print off labels): cell count
    w/diff, BF culture, BF & serum albumin, total protein; cytology if
    c/f malignancy; BF/serum Hct if bloody

- Measure skin/subQ depth with US to help choose sufficiently long
    needle for diagnostic paras
