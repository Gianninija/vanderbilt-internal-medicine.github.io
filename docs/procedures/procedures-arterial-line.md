# Arterial Line

NEJM video Guide: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hK04ai17-k&list=PLaxEyg3FbHI8x5IQMWD0qtbXEzN5RdIKM&index=3>

## Indications

- Continuous, accurate hemodynamic monitoring (pts requiring
    vasopressor titration, pts whose BP accuracy is in question)

- Need for frequent ABGs

## Contraindications

- Abnormal Allen's test, thrombosis of selected site, distorted
    anatomy at selected site (known prior fistulas, grafts,
    malformations), severe PAD at selected site, Raynaud's of selected
    limb

## Consent

- Bruising, pain, damage to adjacent structures, infection, bleeding
    (possible extension to RP bleed with femoral placement), hematoma
    formation, vascular complications (dissection, AV fistula,
    pseudoaneurysm), thrombosis, rarely distal ischemia

## Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** no definitive guidelines (some suggest
    plts \> 50K, INR \< 3, PTT \< 100)

- Palpate of artery of interest to best understand anatomy and
    surrounding structures

- Allen Test if placing radial artery access: goal to assess
    collateral ulnar blood flow to avoid ischemia. Compress both radial
    and ulnar artery 10-15 sec to allow blanching of palm, then release
    ulnar artery to assess re-perfusion. If blanching quickly resolves,
    ulnar artery will allow distal perfusion

- If attempting radial access, ensure wrist is adequately extended;
    use towel roll under wrist and tape hand to bed or table

- Discuss with fellow prior to brachial a-line placement

- Ask RN to prepare tubing and waveform monitoring prior to time-out

## Procedural considerations

- Types of Kits

    - Arrow kit: all-in-one device that has arterial catheter over
        introducer needle

    - A-line kit: individual introducer needle, guidewires, and sutures;
        multiple steps

    - Micropuncture kit: atraumatic guidewire, microcatheter and
        introducer sheath

- Reconfirm location with US after lidocaine

- Ensure arterial access (pulsatile flow of bright red blood)

## Post- procedural considerations

- Immediately connect pressure tubing to catheter while maintaining
    sterile technique

- Observe monitor for arterial waveform to verify appropriate
    placement

- If persistent bleeding, hold pressure for 15 mins
