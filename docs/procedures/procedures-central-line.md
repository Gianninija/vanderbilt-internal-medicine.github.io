# Central Line

NEJM video guide: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeVdRCqy_mo>

## Indications

- Extracorporeal therapies: HD, CRRT, Plasma (PLEX) or RBC exchange
    transfusion

- Venous access for: vasopressors, chemotherapy, parenteral nutrition,
    hemodynamic monitoring (CVP, ScvO2) and cardiac parameters (via PA
    catheter), inadequate peripheral access

## Relative Contraindications

- Increased bleeding risk, anatomic distortion at site selection,
    indwelling vascular hardware (pacemaker, HD access), vascular injury
    proximal to site, skin infection overlying selected site

## Consent

- Immediate complications: bleeding, malposition, arterial puncture,
    arrhythmia, pneumo- or hemothorax, air embolism, damage to
    surrounding structures (nerves, thoracic duct)

- Delayed complications: infection, thromboembolism, myocardial
    perforation, venous stenosis

## Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 20k, INR \< 3

- All patients need to have telemetry & pulse oximetry monitoring

- With every pt, consider LENGTH, LOCATION, LUMENS, and LINE TYPE!

| Internal Jugular Vein | Minimal risk of PTX; improve target with positioning and use of US; easily compressible if bleeding occurs | Risk of carotid puncture, difficult in obese pt; vein collapsibility with hypovolemia       |
| Subclavian            | More comfortable for pts; landmark driven approach; lowest risk infection                                  | Increased risk of PTX, harder to control bleeding with pressure, technically more difficult |
| Femoral               | Easiest to access, no risk of PTX, can be placed during CPR and intubation                                 |                                                                                             |

## Procedural considerations

- Numb pt right after draping, then set up everything to allow time
    for lidocaine to work

- Set supplies up in exactly the order of use to ensure all are
    present and functioning

- Cap side ports with blue claves (not included in Trialysis kit)
    prior to flushing

- For IJ access, place pt in slight Trendelenburg position to engorge
    vein

- While advancing needle, ensure constant negative pressure with
    aspiration of plunger and visualization of needle tip with US

- Designate someone to watch tele while threading guidewire to monitor
    for arrhythmias; limit guidewire insertion depth to no more than 16
    cm to reduce arrhythmia risk

- Always ensure guidewire is secured while it is inside a vein

- Always ensure target for venous cannulation is visualized and
    guidewire is placed correctly prior to dilation: 1) Compression of
    target vessel 2) Non-pulsatile dark blood return (unless on
    100%FiO2, may be brighter red) 3) US visualization or needle and
    wire 4) can use pressure tubing and angiocath to confirm CVP or
    obtain venous O2 sat

## Post-procedural considerations

- Every IJ or subclavian central line needs a confirmation CXR to
    confirm no PTX

- Ideal placement of distal tip: in SVC just outside the right atrium,
    approximately near/superior to carina and right tracheobronchial
    angle

- Troubleshooting Complications:

    - Arterial Access or puncture: immediately remove needle and hold
        pressure for 15 mins to prevent hematoma formation; if uncontrolled
        bleeding or artery was dilated, STAT vascular surgery consult

    - Bleeding: place direct pressure; subclavian access precludes ability
        to compress and confers highest bleeding risk; if uncontrolled, STAT
        vascular surgery consult

    - Pulmonary Complications: if free air aspirated into syringe,
        consider PTX vs poor seal of syringe & needle. Close attention to
        pulmonary complication & STAT CXR to assess PTX. If rapid
        deterioration, needle decompression and chest tube placement
        required

    - Venous Air Embolism: can occur if air introduced to system during
        placement, flushing, or if left open to the atmosphere. Effects are
        variable, but if suspected, place pt in left lateral decubitus
        position to trap air in right apex and place pt on 100% O2 to speed
        resorption

    - Arrhythmia: rationale for telemetry monitoring as guidewire can lead
        to atrial or ventricular arrhythmias; immediately withdraw wire to
        lesser depth; if arrythmia persists, abort procedure and treat
        patient and determine cause
