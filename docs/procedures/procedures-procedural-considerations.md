# Procedural considerations

- Ultrasound Probe: curvilinear

- Identify safe pocket (\>2 cm deep), with no nearby bowel or
    adhesions

- Local anesthesia with lidocaine all the way to peritoneum, as this
    is most sensitive part

- Kit: 6 Fr Safe-T-Centesis Kit; gather cx bottles, cx bottle syringe
    adaptor, specimen cup

- If only diagnostic, use 18G needle with 20-50cc syringe rather than
    kit

- If high bleeding risk, use long 18G needle & attach to syringe
    instead of 6 Fr. Catheter

- Avoid surgical scars out of concern for nearby adhesions and
    superficial veins

- Attempt as lateral as possible to avoid inferior epigastric vessels

- Roll patient to left or right side to promote pooling of fluid for
    easier/safer access

- Inoculate culture bottles at bedside rather than sending fluid
    samples to lab for inoculation to increase yield 50% 80% (Note that
    VA does not allow bedside inoculation.)

- If hernia present, have patient reduce it while draining fluid to
    prevent incarceration

## Post-procedural considerations

- Albumin (25%) for large volume (\>5L fluid removal): give 8 g per
    liter removed, up to 50 g

- Ascitic leak: Can try skin glue or place 1 figure-of-eight stitch
    with 4.0 vicryl

- Bleeding complication: hold pressure with quick-clot and gauze for
    \>5-10 mins if persistent bleeding at site; if profuse bleeding or
    concern for organ injury, STAT page EGS and/or IR
