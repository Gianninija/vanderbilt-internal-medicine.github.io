# Anesthesia and Sedation

- May be used when pain or anxiety may impede performance and success

- Relative Contraindications: old age, dementia, respiratory
    difficulty

- Aim to use local anesthesia with l% to minimize procedural sedation

- Creating wheal: clean surface w/ chlorhexidine or alcohol swab; with
    22-25G needle, advance needle nearly parallel to skin and aspirate
    to ensure no blood vessel involved, then inject anesthetic to create
    1-2 cm of raised skin; If deeper subcutaneous anesthesia is needed,
    advance needle perpendicular to skin, aspirate as advancing then
    inject the tract, inject anesthetic as needle is withdrawn

- Local anesthesia can alter landmarks, always double check anatomy
    after injection

- Minimal Sedation: 0.25mg-2mg Ativan IV or 1mg-2.5mg Midazolam IV

    - Midazolam (Versed): faster on (2-5 min) and faster off (30-60 min)

    - Lorazepam (Ativan): onset 5-10 min; Duration 4-8 hours
