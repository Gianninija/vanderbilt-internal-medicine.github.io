# US-Guided PIV

VUMC video Guide: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQGhciB6TvM>

## Indications

- Vascular access; large bore (16-18G) is optimal for blood
    transfusion and faster than central lines (except MAC/Cordis);
    preserves central access (important for ESRD patients)

## Relative Contraindications

- Infection over the site, severe bleeding diathesis

- Avoid EJs unless have been trained due to airway compromise if
    extravasation occurs

## Consent

- Common risks: arterial puncture, nerve irritation/damage, infection,
    infiltration, thrombus formation

## Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 10k, no specific INR
    guidelines

- Location selection: anuric AKI or ESRD patients – d/w renal, avoid
    limb with HD access proximal

- Target selection: Confirm venous choice with compressibility and
    lack of doppler flow. Should follow the rule of 2s: vein must be at
    least twice the diameter of the catheter being placed, should be no
    more than 2 inches in depth from the surface of the skin, and should
    have at least 2 inches of straight (non-tortuous) length

## Procedural considerations

- US Probe: Linear

- Kit: IV start kit; ideally 18G needle

- Anesthetic use: Consider EMLA

- 1st choice: basilic, cephalic veins; 2nd choice: brachial vein
    (caution adjacent artery)

- Use tourniquet

- Start at 45° angle, use 45-45-90 rule to determine starting location
    (start as far from center of probe as the vessel is deep), flatten
    angle once in the vessel to advance ("walk" your way through the
    vessel by repeatedly identifying needle tip in the lumen and
    advancing)

- Going too shallow could use up too much catheter leaving nothing to
    put in the vein.

- Going too steep can cause catheter kinking at the hub where it
    sticks out of the skin

- Hold probe close to skin, holding probe far from the end allows too
    much movement

- Center the vessel on the ultrasound probe screen prior to sticking,
    place midline on US screen

- Use both short axis and long axis views to ensure correct placement

- Short axis- Vessel looks round like a target, helps to scout out the
    tip, and is best for ensuring the vein is entered as opposed to a
    neighboring artery

- Long axis- The length of the vessel is viewed. This view is intended
    for the final few millimeters of catheter advancement into the vein
    to ensure both bevel and plastic sheath lumen traverse the
    endothelial layer before threading catheter

## Post-procedural considerations

- DON’T FORGET TO REMOVE TOURNIQUET!! Remove before flushing to
    prevent blowing vein

- Bleeding complication: if arterial, remove catheter & hold pressure
    at least 5 mins
