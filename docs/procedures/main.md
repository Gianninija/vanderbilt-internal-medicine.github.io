Anticoagulation and Bleeding Risk

| Anticoagulant         | How Long to Hold          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Heparin gtt           | 4-8 hours, ensure PTT wnl |
| LMWH                  | 12-24 hours               |
| Dabigatran (Pradaxa)  | 1-2 days                  |
| Apixaban (Eliquis)    | 1-2 day                   |
| Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) | 1-2 days                  |
| Warfarin (Coumadin)   | 5-7 days                  |

Platelets, INR: refer to individual procedure sections for
procedure-specific guidelines

Anesthesia and Sedation

- May be used when pain or anxiety may impede performance and success

- Relative Contraindications: old age, dementia, respiratory
    difficulty

- Aim to use local anesthesia with l% to minimize procedural sedation

- Creating wheal: clean surface w/ chlorhexidine or alcohol swab; with
    22-25G needle, advance needle nearly parallel to skin and aspirate
    to ensure no blood vessel involved, then inject anesthetic to create
    1-2 cm of raised skin; If deeper subcutaneous anesthesia is needed,
    advance needle perpendicular to skin, aspirate as advancing then
    inject the tract, inject anesthetic as needle is withdrawn

- Local anesthesia can alter landmarks, always double check anatomy
    after injection

- Minimal Sedation: 0.25mg-2mg Ativan IV or 1mg-2.5mg Midazolam IV

<!-- -->

- Midazolam (Versed): faster on (2-5 min) and faster off (30-60 min)

- Lorazepam (Ativan): onset 5-10 min; Duration 4-8 hours

Paracentesis

Video Guide

- VUMC Procedure Service video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQSsb9705LE&t=160s>
- NEJM video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVpwXK7cvzQ>

Indications

- Diagnostic: Evaluation of new onset ascites or of known ascites with
    concern for SBP

- Therapeutic: tense ascites, refractory to diuretics, causing pt
    discomfort

Relative Contraindications

- Significant bowel distension due to ileus or SBO, hemodynamic
    instability (due to large fluid shifts with LVP), DIC,
    infection/breakdown of skin overlying puncture site

Consent

- Risks: abdominal wall hematoma (1%), hemoperitoneum, organ puncture
    / bowel perforation, infection, ascitic fluid leak

Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 20k, INR \< 4 \* (note that
    cirrhosis complicates INR interpretation)

- If therapeutic, determine volume pt typically gets drained so you
    have enough bottles (tip: call service center to request bottles be
    sent to RN station if you can't find enough)

- Labs (order before so nurse can print off labels): cell count
    w/diff, BF culture, BF & serum albumin, total protein; cytology if
    c/f malignancy; BF/serum Hct if bloody

- Measure skin/subQ depth with US to help choose sufficiently long
    needle for diagnostic paras

Procedural considerations

- Ultrasound Probe: curvilinear

- Identify safe pocket (\>2 cm deep), with no nearby bowel or
    adhesions

- Local anesthesia with lidocaine all the way to peritoneum, as this
    is most sensitive part

- Kit: 6 Fr Safe-T-Centesis Kit; gather cx bottles, cx bottle syringe
    adaptor, specimen cup

- If only diagnostic, use 18G needle with 20-50cc syringe rather than
    kit

- If high bleeding risk, use long 18G needle & attach to syringe
    instead of 6 Fr. Catheter

- Avoid surgical scars out of concern for nearby adhesions and
    superficial veins

- Attempt as lateral as possible to avoid inferior epigastric vessels

- Roll patient to left or right side to promote pooling of fluid for
    easier/safer access

- Inoculate culture bottles at bedside rather than sending fluid
    samples to lab for inoculation to increase yield 50% 80% (Note that
    VA does not allow bedside inoculation.)

- If hernia present, have patient reduce it while draining fluid to
    prevent incarceration

Post-procedural considerations

- Albumin (25%) for large volume (\>5L fluid removal): give 8 g per
    liter removed, up to 50 g

- Ascitic leak: Can try skin glue or place 1 figure-of-eight stitch
    with 4.0 vicryl

- Bleeding complication: hold pressure with quick-clot and gauze for
    \>5-10 mins if persistent bleeding at site; if profuse bleeding or
    concern for organ injury, STAT page EGS and/or IR

Thoracentesis

NEJM Video Guide: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivTyH09BcHg>

Indications

- New pleural effusion that has no obvious explanation (not attributed
    to HF alone) or concern for pleural space infection

- Any respiratory symptoms that would positively respond to large
    volume thoracentesis (\>1L)

Contraindications

- Skin infection at needle insertion site

- Large-volume thoracentesis in hepatic hydrothorax (tends to
    reaccumulate). Suspected unexpandable lung

Consent

- Common risks (\> 5%): coughing, fainting, PTX

- Rare risks (\< 1%): hemothorax, re-expansion pulmonary edema,
    liver/spleen puncture

Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 50k, INR \< 2 \* (risk/benefit
    evaluation outside these)

- If loculations present on US, high risk, or any question about
    indication, refer to Pulm

- Labs (order before so nurse can print labels): cell count w/diff; BF
    culture, BF & serum LDH, BF & serum total protein; BF & serum Hct if
    bloody; cytology if c/f malignancy; consider triglycerides if
    concerned for chylothorax

Procedural considerations

- US Probe: Cardiac (or Linear) to identify safe pocket (\>2 cm)
    between lung and diaphragm (ask Interventional Pulm or IR if sample
    is needed of a smaller pocket)

- Kit: 6Fr Safe-T-Centesis kit

- Upright position is typically preferred; lateral to mid-scap/mid-ax.
    If patient unable to sit upright, refer to procedure team vs
    pulmonology

- Effusion size: if unable to tap above 9th rib, too small; CXR with
    costophrenic angle blunting should correlate to \~250-500mL

- Insert needle superior to rib to avoid neurovascular bundle (bundles
    run below)

- Stop if pt has any new/increased chest discomfort, aggressive
    unremitting cough, frank purulence or air on aspiration,
    lightheadedness, hypotension, or vagal response

- Stop fluid removal after 1.5 L of chronic pleural effusion to reduce
    re-expansion pulmonary edema

Post-procedural considerations

- If needing cytology, send at least 60 – 100cc

- Bleeding complication: STAT page Thoracic Surgery

- PTX: if pt stable & asymptomatic, supplemental O2 and repeat CXR in
    4hrs; if unstable/symptomatic STAT page to Thoracic Surgery

- Re-expansion pulmonary edema: persistent cough, frothy sputum.
    Diffuse GGO on side of thoracentesis. Supportive management (oxygen,
    monitor); most resolve in 24-48 hrs. If respiratory distress
    progresses, may need mechanical ventilation

- Documentation: Effusion US characteristics (anechoic, layering
    debris, septations), reason for ending procedure (stopped early due
    to chest discomfort, complication vs tapped dry), presence of lung
    sliding, if more than scant residual effusion remains post-procedure

- A routine chest radiograph after thoracentesis is no longer
    indicated for most asymptomatic, non-ventilated patients. Check lung
    slide with US in 2D and M-mode

Central Line

NEJM video guide: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeVdRCqy_mo>

Indications

- Extracorporeal therapies: HD, CRRT, Plasma (PLEX) or RBC exchange
    transfusion

- Venous access for: vasopressors, chemotherapy, parenteral nutrition,
    hemodynamic monitoring (CVP, ScvO2) and cardiac parameters (via PA
    catheter), inadequate peripheral access

Relative Contraindications

- Increased bleeding risk, anatomic distortion at site selection,
    indwelling vascular hardware (pacemaker, HD access), vascular injury
    proximal to site, skin infection overlying selected site

Consent

- Immediate complications: bleeding, malposition, arterial puncture,
    arrhythmia, pneumo- or hemothorax, air embolism, damage to
    surrounding structures (nerves, thoracic duct)

- Delayed complications: infection, thromboembolism, myocardial
    perforation, venous stenosis

Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 20k, INR \< 3

- All patients need to have telemetry & pulse oximetry monitoring

- With every pt, consider LENGTH, LOCATION, LUMENS, and LINE TYPE!

|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Internal Jugular Vein | Minimal risk of PTX; improve target with positioning and use of US; easily compressible if bleeding occurs | Risk of carotid puncture, difficult in obese pt; vein collapsibility with hypovolemia       |
| Subclavian            | More comfortable for pts; landmark driven approach; lowest risk infection                                  | Increased risk of PTX, harder to control bleeding with pressure, technically more difficult |
| Femoral               | Easiest to access, no risk of PTX, can be placed during CPR and intubation                                 |                                                                                             |

Procedural considerations

- Numb pt right after draping, then set up everything to allow time
    for lidocaine to work

- Set supplies up in exactly the order of use to ensure all are
    present and functioning

- Cap side ports with blue claves (not included in Trialysis kit)
    prior to flushing

- For IJ access, place pt in slight Trendelenburg position to engorge
    vein

- While advancing needle, ensure constant negative pressure with
    aspiration of plunger and visualization of needle tip with US

- Designate someone to watch tele while threading guidewire to monitor
    for arrhythmias; limit guidewire insertion depth to no more than 16
    cm to reduce arrhythmia risk

- Always ensure guidewire is secured while it is inside a vein

- Always ensure target for venous cannulation is visualized and
    guidewire is placed correctly prior to dilation: 1) Compression of
    target vessel 2) Non-pulsatile dark blood return (unless on
    100%FiO2, may be brighter red) 3) US visualization or needle and
    wire 4) can use pressure tubing and angiocath to confirm CVP or
    obtain venous O2 sat

Post-procedural considerations

- Every IJ or subclavian central line needs a confirmation CXR to
    confirm no PTX

- Ideal placement of distal tip: in SVC just outside the right atrium,
    approximately near/superior to carina and right tracheobronchial
    angle

- Troubleshooting Complications:

<!-- -->

- Arterial Access or puncture: immediately remove needle and hold
    pressure for 15 mins to prevent hematoma formation; if uncontrolled
    bleeding or artery was dilated, STAT vascular surgery consult

- Bleeding: place direct pressure; subclavian access precludes ability
    to compress and confers highest bleeding risk; if uncontrolled, STAT
    vascular surgery consult

- Pulmonary Complications: if free air aspirated into syringe,
    consider PTX vs poor seal of syringe & needle. Close attention to
    pulmonary complication & STAT CXR to assess PTX. If rapid
    deterioration, needle decompression and chest tube placement
    required

- Venous Air Embolism: can occur if air introduced to system during
    placement, flushing, or if left open to the atmosphere. Effects are
    variable, but if suspected, place pt in left lateral decubitus
    position to trap air in right apex and place pt on 100% O2 to speed
    resorption

- Arrhythmia: rationale for telemetry monitoring as guidewire can lead
    to atrial or ventricular arrhythmias; immediately withdraw wire to
    lesser depth; if arrythmia persists, abort procedure and treat
    patient and determine cause

Lumbar Puncture

NEJM video Guide: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnH9gECy_wU>

Indications

- Diagnosis of suspected CNS infections, CNS malignancies,
    demyelinating diseases, IIH, NPH, autoimmune encephalitis, suspected
    SAH with negative imaging

Absolute Contraindications

- Increased intracranial pressure with risk of herniation (i.e.
    space-occupying lesions, cerebral edema, obstructive hydrocephalus),
    infection or epidural abscess over puncture site, trauma to lumbar
    vertebrae

Relative Contraindications

- ↑ intracranial pressure, thrombocytopenia, bleeding diatheses

Consent

- Common risks: back pain (\~66%), severe headache

- Rare risks: spinal hematoma (\<0.001%), weakness, radicular
    pain/numbness, bleeding, brain function problems, CNS infection,
    brain herniation

Pre-procedural considerations:

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 50k, INR \< 1.6 (stricter
    guidelines d/t spinal hematoma risk)

- CT head not generally needed prior to LP to rule out mass lesion;
    consider if presence of focal neurologic signs, papilledema, recent
    seizure, or immunocompromise

- Consider sending to fluoro-guided if: attempts without imaging are
    unsuccessful, obese pts with no palpable anatomy, severe scoliosis,
    prior spine surgery, borderline low plts and multiple sticks might
    be needed, or pt requires heavy sedation

- Anticoagulation: full dose LMWH must be off 24h, ppx LMWH off 12h,
    ppx heparin off 8h, hep gtt off 4-8hrs with repeat lab demonstrating
    normalized PT, P2Y12 inhibitors should be off 7 days to avoid
    bleeding risks, IR guidelines require Plavix to be off 5 days (ASA
    alone is OK)

- Labs: cell count w/diff, BF culture, glucose, protein; freeze sample
    for future/additional labs (order in epic); if infectious or
    neurological labs are needed, consider consult first

- Ensure lateral decubitus position for opening pressure with glass
    pressure manometer

Procedural considerations

- US Probe: Linear (can use curvilinear in obese pts) in transverse
    axis to establish midline & in sagittal axis to identify spinous
    processes

- Anesthetic use: Lidocaine 1-2% (likely need more than what is
    provided in kit; consider empiric anesthetization of 2 spaces +/-
    Pain-Ease spray

- Increased number of attempts = increased success rates

- Higher rate of success if stylet is removed before entering
    subarachnoid space to better observe flow of CSF once in the
    subarachnoid space. Stylet should be replaced prior to LP needle
    removal

- Aspiration of CSF = increased risk of bleeding. Don’t aspirate!

- Volume removal for studies: Basic only 2mL per tube in 1-4. Many
    studies ordered: 3mL per tube (\*consider calling lab to confirm).
    Cytology desired: call lab to confirm amount needed (rule of thumb
    2/2/6/2mL); Tube 4 is sent for micro to reduce contamination.
    Therapeutic high volume: 30mL max

Post-procedural considerations

- Post-LP headache (\~10%): encourage pt to lay flat to reduce the
    intensity of symptoms (but does not prevent it); if prolonged,
    consider blood patch (c/s Anesthesia)

- Neuro changes OR bleeding complications: STAT non-contrast MRI
    lumbar spine for epidural hematoma, q1 neuro-checks x4hrs then q2
    for 24-48hrs & consult NSGY

- Sample cannot be tubed; someone must walk fluid to the lab

- Resuming anticoagulation: 1h UFH, 4h LMWH, 6-8h
    rivaroxaban/apixaban, 6h dabigatran/fondaparinux. Longer periods
    should be considered after traumatic tap, and post-procedure
    monitoring of neurological function is recommended for all pts

Arterial Line

NEJM video Guide: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hK04ai17-k&list=PLaxEyg3FbHI8x5IQMWD0qtbXEzN5RdIKM&index=3>

Indications

- Continuous, accurate hemodynamic monitoring (pts requiring
    vasopressor titration, pts whose BP accuracy is in question)

- Need for frequent ABGs

Contraindications

- Abnormal Allen's test, thrombosis of selected site, distorted
    anatomy at selected site (known prior fistulas, grafts,
    malformations), severe PAD at selected site, Raynaud's of selected
    limb

Consent

- Bruising, pain, damage to adjacent structures, infection, bleeding
    (possible extension to RP bleed with femoral placement), hematoma
    formation, vascular complications (dissection, AV fistula,
    pseudoaneurysm), thrombosis, rarely distal ischemia

Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** no definitive guidelines (some suggest
    plts \> 50K, INR \< 3, PTT \< 100)

- Palpate of artery of interest to best understand anatomy and
    surrounding structures

- Allen Test if placing radial artery access: goal to assess
    collateral ulnar blood flow to avoid ischemia. Compress both radial
    and ulnar artery 10-15 sec to allow blanching of palm, then release
    ulnar artery to assess re-perfusion. If blanching quickly resolves,
    ulnar artery will allow distal perfusion

- If attempting radial access, ensure wrist is adequately extended;
    use towel roll under wrist and tape hand to bed or table

- Discuss with fellow prior to brachial a-line placement

- Ask RN to prepare tubing and waveform monitoring prior to time-out

Procedural considerations

- Types of Kits

<!-- -->

- Arrow kit: all-in-one device that has arterial catheter over
    introducer needle

- A-line kit: individual introducer needle, guidewires, and sutures;
    multiple steps

- Micropuncture kit: atraumatic guidewire, microcatheter and
    introducer sheath

<!-- -->

- Reconfirm location with US after lidocaine

- Ensure arterial access (pulsatile flow of bright red blood)

Post- procedural considerations

- Immediately connect pressure tubing to catheter while maintaining
    sterile technique

- Observe monitor for arterial waveform to verify appropriate
    placement

- If persistent bleeding, hold pressure for 15 mins

US-Guided PIV

VUMC video Guide: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQGhciB6TvM>

Indications

- Vascular access; large bore (16-18G) is optimal for blood
    transfusion and faster than central lines (except MAC/Cordis);
    preserves central access (important for ESRD patients)

Relative Contraindications

- Infection over the site, severe bleeding diathesis

- Avoid EJs unless have been trained due to airway compromise if
    extravasation occurs

Consent

- Common risks: arterial puncture, nerve irritation/damage, infection,
    infiltration, thrombus formation

Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 10k, no specific INR
    guidelines

- Location selection: anuric AKI or ESRD patients – d/w renal, avoid
    limb with HD access proximal

- Target selection: Confirm venous choice with compressibility and
    lack of doppler flow. Should follow the rule of 2s: vein must be at
    least twice the diameter of the catheter being placed, should be no
    more than 2 inches in depth from the surface of the skin, and should
    have at least 2 inches of straight (non-tortuous) length

Procedural considerations

- US Probe: Linear

- Kit: IV start kit; ideally 18G needle

- Anesthetic use: Consider EMLA

- 1st choice: basilic, cephalic veins; 2nd choice: brachial vein
    (caution adjacent artery)

- Use tourniquet

- Start at 45° angle, use 45-45-90 rule to determine starting location
    (start as far from center of probe as the vessel is deep), flatten
    angle once in the vessel to advance ("walk" your way through the
    vessel by repeatedly identifying needle tip in the lumen and
    advancing)

- Going too shallow could use up too much catheter leaving nothing to
    put in the vein.

- Going too steep can cause catheter kinking at the hub where it
    sticks out of the skin

- Hold probe close to skin, holding probe far from the end allows too
    much movement

- Center the vessel on the ultrasound probe screen prior to sticking,
    place midline on US screen

- Use both short axis and long axis views to ensure correct placement

- Short axis- Vessel looks round like a target, helps to scout out the
    tip, and is best for ensuring the vein is entered as opposed to a
    neighboring artery

- Long axis- The length of the vessel is viewed. This view is intended
    for the final few millimeters of catheter advancement into the vein
    to ensure both bevel and plastic sheath lumen traverse the
    endothelial layer before threading catheter

Post-procedural considerations

- DON’T FORGET TO REMOVE TOURNIQUET!! Remove before flushing to
    prevent blowing vein

- Bleeding complication: if arterial, remove catheter & hold pressure
    at least 5 mins

Dobhoff Tube

Indications

- Enteral feeding and medication administration if unable to swallow

- DHT v NGT: DHT deliver meds and fluids, NGT provide suction to
    decompress (can also deliver meds/fluids); nurses place NGT,
    residents (and ICU nurses) place DHT qUh5AJ5uIZo

Relative Contraindications

- Esophageal varices or strictures (most hepatologists say this is not
    a contra-indication, but discuss if recent bleed or recent banding)

- Other altered gastric anatomy that may prevent passage. (i.e.
    gastric bypass, esophageal hernias, tumors or other possible
    obstructions)

- SBO or ileus (use NGT instead for suction)

Absolute Contraindications for blind approach

- Facial trauma, basilar skull fracture, pharyngeal or esophageal
    trauma

Consent

- Common risks: malposition (lung -\> pneumothorax or pneumonia;
    pyriform sinus; coiling anywhere along tract); perforation anywhere
    along the tract; aspiration, nasal ulceration, esophagitis,
    gastritis, bleeding, vagal response, discomfort

Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 10k, no specific INR
    guidelines

- Make sure DHT and bridle sizes correlate

- Measure expected advancement depth by measuring distance from tip of
    nose, around ear, and to xiphoid process

- Prior to placement, fasten the stylet in the fully-hubbed position
    to reduce bending and folding over of the weighted tip while
    advancing

- Apply anesthetic with lidocaine gel (order Lidocaine uro-jet) and
    nasal swab to reduce pt discomfort, reduce gag reflex, and assist
    with clearance of the nasal passages

- Consider fluoro-guided placement after 3 failed bedside attempts

- Post-pyloric placement

<!-- -->

- Consider in patients with high pulmonary aspiration risk, severe
    esophageal reflux/esophagitis, recurrent emesis, impaired gastric
    mobility, and pancreatitis

- Refer for fluoro-guided post-pyloric advancement after 1 failed
    bedside attempt

Procedural Considerations

- Have the patient sit upright with their head tilted toward the chest
    to encourage posterior oropharyngeal positioning of the DHT while
    advancing

- Tip: advance horizontally (nose tip to ear lobe), not angled up

- If pt can participate safely, have the patient swallow in
    conjunction with advancement; pt can suck on straw (with small sips
    of water if low aspiration risk) to utilize pharyngeal muscles to
    position DHT into esophagus

- Place bridle and dog-bone tape while at the bedside to reduce
    dislodgement

- Excessive coughing, difficulty phonating, or resistance may indicate
    tracheal placement; withdraw tube and re-attempt. Consider Duonebs
    to reduce bronchospasms

- Post-pyloric placement has been shown to be up to 90% successful
    with intermittent insufflation of 10-20cc of air \~every 10cm of
    advancement after 55cm to promote pylorus opening. IV Reglan or
    erythromycin may also help

- When placing bridle (recommend AFTER xray confirmation), keep
    alignment markers (marked on both probes) together so magnetic tips
    will align once past the nasal septum

- When placing the bridle, remove the green stylet housed within the
    white probe before retracting back and removing the white probe

Post-procedural Considerations

- ALWAYS confirm position radiographically via KUB before medications
    are given!

- Insufflation of air and auscultation of bowel sounds over the
    gastric area can be reassuring of correct placement of DHT prior to
    taping/bridling and leaving the bedside

- Most mispositioned/coiled tubes have to be removed and re-attempted,
    but it is ok to advance or withdraw if Stylet is still in place.
    However, once removed, a stylet should not be re-introduced to a
    mispositioned/coiled tube due to risk of GI perforation

- In case of cranial placement, don’t remove, consult NSGY

- De-clogging: Clog Zapper Kit (can type this into Epic directly);
    coca cola
