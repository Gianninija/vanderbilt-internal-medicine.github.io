## Corticosteroids: General Principles 
-	Main side effects ➔ skin atrophy
-	Face and intertriginous areas ➔ low potency steroids ONLY 
-	High potency steroids should be limited to 3 weeks of use 
-	Optimal absorption if applied after bathing (hydration promotes steroid penetration) 
- <b>	Ointments </b> - most potent due to occlusive effect, good for thick, hyperkeratotic lesions and areas of smooth, NON-hairy skin. Avoid hairy and intertriginous areas (can cause skin maceration and folliculitis) 
- <b>	Creams </b> - more cosmetically appearing and well tolerated. Less potent than ointments 
-	<b> Lotions </b> - useful in hairy and intertriginous areas. Less potent than creams
