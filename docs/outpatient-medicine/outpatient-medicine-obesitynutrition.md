## Background
-	BMI = Body Weight (kg) / Height (meters)<sup>2</sup>
-	42% of US adults are obese. 74% of adults are overweight or obese.

## Evaluation
-	USPTF: Pts with BMI >30 should be offered or referred to intensive, multicomponent behavioral interventions
-	Screen for co-morbidities: HTN (BP), HLD (lipid panel), DM (A1c), MAFLD (LFTs), OSA (polysomnography), consider TSH if other symptoms of thyroid dysfunction

## Management
-	Goals:
    -	Target weight loss of 5-7% body weight
    -	An average deficit of 500 kcal/day should result in an initial weight loss of ~0.5 kg/week (1 lb/week)
    -	Even weight loss of 3-5% produces clinically meaningful health benefits
    -	Regaining weight is common, schedule frequent follow up to assess and encourage progress
    -	Have pts keep a food log or recall last 24 hrs of food history in clinic
    -	Limit high caloric beverages and processed foods first
    -	Encourage accountability partners
    -	Share MyPlate information
    -	Consider weight loss apps: My Fitness Pal, Lose it, Noom
-	Dietary options:
    -	Total calorie restriction is the most effective dietary intervention for weight loss
    -	Generally, encourage patients to pursue whatever dietary intervention is most sustainable for their lifestyles
    -	Mediterranean diet: high in fresh vegetables/fruits, whole grains, legumes, unsaturated fats, moderate diary and EtOH, less meat
    -	Associated with decreased overall mortality and CV mortality, may decrease DM incidence independent of weight loss
    -	DASH diet: 4-5 servings of fruit, 4-5 servings of vegetables, 2-3 servings of lowfat dairy per day, and <25 percent dietary intake from fat
    -	Associated with decreases in SBP and DBP
    -	There is mixed evidence for intermittent fasting, low carb, low fat, and high protein diets
-	Exercise: goal >30 min, 5-7 days per week
    -	Ideally combination of aerobic and resistance training
    -	Exercise alone is not sufficient for weight loss. Associated with maintaining weight loss
-	Pharmacotherapy
    -	BMI ≥30 or ≥27 with co-morbidity
    -	Leads to significant short term weight loss, high rates of rebound, weight gain
-	Bariatric Surgery:  
    -	Indicated for patients with BMI >40 or >35 with obesity related co-morbidity and failed lifestyle intervention
    -	Referral to Surgical Weight Loss Clinic 
-	Medical Weight Loss Clinic:
    -	Can refer for patient with BMI >30 or >27 with obesity related co-morbidity
    -	VA: Consider referral to MOVE program (in-person or telehealth options)
