# Fatigue

Lauren Waskowicz

## Background 
- Obtain a thorough history and validate the pt's concerns
    - Assess chronicity: acute <1 month,  subacute 1-6 months, chronic >6 months
    - Thorough review of systems, as well as questions regarding lifestyle (diet/exercise/sleep and any substance use) and social factors (financial/relationship stressors)
    - Assess impact on daily life and accommodations the pt has made to cope 
- Review medication list, age related cancer screening, prior lab values and imaging 

## Common Etiologies  
- In otherwise well appearing individual consider first screening for:
    - Anemia, iron deficiency (even if anemia isn’t present)
    - Liver/Kidney dysfunction
    - Thyroid disease
    - Mood disorder (anxiety, depression, adjustment disorder, substance use)
    - Sleep Disorder (OSA, narcolepsy, REM sleep disorder, shift work disorder) 
- If above screening is negative or patient is not well appearing, can also consider
    - Cardiopulmonary: CHF, CAD/angina, PVD, obstructive lung disease
    - Endocrine: Diabetes, adrenal insufficiency
    - Hematologic/Neoplastic: occult malignancy
    - Infectious: HIV, mononucleosis, hepatitis, TB, fungal, parasitic, long-covid
    - Medication Use: opioids, benzodiazepines, antihistamines, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, beta-blockers, GABA analogues, substances
    - Rheumatologic: fibromyalgia, PMR, SLE, RA, Sjögren's
    - Neurologic: multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis 

## Evaluation 
- Complete physical exam
- Lab tests to order if >1 month duration:
    - Initial screening should include CMP, CBC w/ diff, iron studies, TSH
    - If not previously evaluated, can check HIV, hepatidities, A1c 
- Assess for mood disorder (PHQ-9, GAD7)
- Assess for sleep disturbance (STOP-BANG, Epworth Sleepiness Scale) ± sleep study
- Age appropriate cancer screening if applicable
- Other considerations: family medical history, domestic violence, housing insecurity, substance use, new medications (OTC, supplements) 

## Management 
- Treatment is largely specific to underlying etiology of fatigue (if found)
- Etiology may never be identified; if undiagnosed for >6 mo, consider myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) as a diagnosis of exclusion
- Consider empiric trial of antidepressant (SSRI/SNRI/Bupropion) in those with residual/idiopathic fatigue and depressed mood – even if pt does not meet MDD criteria
- Consider referral to long-COVID clinic if symptom timeline indicative of post-covid exposure
