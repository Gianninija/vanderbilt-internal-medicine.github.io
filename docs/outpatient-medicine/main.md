Obesity/Nutrition – Mackenzie Samson

Background

- BMI = Body Weight (kg) / Height (meters)2

- Underweight = BMI \<18.5

- Normal = BMI 18.5-24.9

- Overweight = BMI 25.0-29.9

- Obesity:

<!-- -->

- Class I 30-34.9

- Class II 35-39.9

- Class IIIA 40-44.9

- Class IIIB 45-49.9

- Class IIIC 50+

Management

- Goals: Target initial weight loss of 5-7% body weight, schedule
    frequent follow up to assess progress. Request pts send 48 hr food
    log. Encourage accountability “buddies.” Consider weight loss apps:
    My Fitness Pal, Lose it, Noom

- Dietary options:

<!-- -->

- Calorie restriction \> macronutrient composition (e.g., low fat, low
    carb)

- Mediterranean: high in unsaturated fats, fruit/veg, legumes, grain,
    moderate dairy & EtOH, less meat. Adherence leads to decreased
    overall mortality and CV mortality; may decrease diabetes incidence
    independent of weight loss

- Dot phrases below for pictoral representation of cultural diets
    adapted to fit Mediterranean guidelines (Asian, African, Latin
    American)

- DASH: High in fruits/vegetables, moderate dairy, \< 25% caloric
    intake from fat (decreases SBP/DBP)

<!-- -->

- Exercise: \>30 min, 5-7 days per week, ideally a combo of aerobic +
    resistance training.

<!-- -->

- Exercise alone is not sufficient for weight loss

<!-- -->

- Medications: If BMI ≥30 or BMI ≥27 with ≥1 comorbidity. Significant
    short term weight loss (\~ 5-15 lbs), but weight is typically gained
    back when stopped. See table below

- Referral to medical weight loss: If BMI ≥ 30 or BMI ≥27 with
    comorbid conditions (fatty liver disease, diabetes mellitus, HTN,
    OSA)

- Referral to surgical weight loss: If BMI ≥40 or BMI ≥35 with
    comorbid conditions

- VA: consider referral to MOVE program (in person/telehealth options)

Lipids – Brittany Saldivar

Background

- 1º Prevention: pts at increased risk who have not yet had a vascular
    event

- 2º Prevention: pts with pre-existing occlusive vascular disease or
    ASCVD (e.g., stroke, TIA, CAD + angina, ACS, coronary or arterial
    revascularization, PAD)

- Screening: USPSTF 2016 Guidelines: q5years for adults 40-75yrs

<!-- -->

- ACC/AHA 2019 Guideline: adults 20-39 q 4-6yrs; \<21yrs if strong fam
    hx; 40-75 “routinely” assess CV risk and calculate 10 yr ASCVD risk
    (lipid pnl q3-12 months)

- Dot phrase: .ASCVD2013

Evaluation

- Fasting vs Non-Fasting Lipid Panel

<!-- -->

- Triglycerides are most impacted by non-fasting testing which can
    artificially lower LDL-C depending on how the laboratory
    measures/calculates LDL. Consider fasting lipid panels when
    triglyceride levels are high

<!-- -->

- Consider 2º causes of HLD in initial workup: hypothyroidism, DM,
    EtOH use, smoking, liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, CKD, meds
    (e.g., thiazide, glucocorticoids)

Management

- Lifestyle changes:

<!-- -->

- Heart Healthy Diet: ↓ trans/saturated fats, choose skim milk,
    low-fat dairy products

- Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, poultry, fish, nuts and
    olive oil, while limiting red and processed meats, sodium and
    sugar-sweetened foods and beverages

- Promote a healthy weight, regular exercise, smoking cessation, limit
    EtOH

Statin Therapy

- Initiate as outlined in the following algorithms

- Check AST/ALT prior to initiation

- Note that PCE used to estimate ASCVD risk is best validated for
    non-Hispanic whites and blacks. Consider use of additional risk
    prediction tools/factors in other patient populations

Statin Options

Statin Side effects:

- Spectrum of statin associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) include
    myalgias, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, autoimmune myopathy

<!-- -->

- Myalgias: bilateral involving large muscle groups, onset within
    weeks of initiation of therapy and should resolve within weeks of
    cessation; CK should be normal

- Consider evaluation with CK, BMP, TSH, and vitamin D

- ACC has a “Statin Intolerance Calculator” to help assess etiology of
    symptoms

Additional Information

- If patient is not tolerating a statin, consider:

<!-- -->

- Holding statin until symptoms resolve and trialing lower dose or
    alternative statin (Pravastatin and Fluvastatin may have lower risks
    of myopathy)

- Every other day dosing with atorvastatin and rosuvastatin (longer
    half-lives)

<!-- -->

- If repeated failed attempts, consider alternative agents: Ezetimibe,
    PCSK9 inhibitor

- PCSK9 inhibitor requires referral to Lipid Clinic

Hypertriglyceridemia:

- Moderate: TG 175-499 mg/dL; Moderate-severe 500 - 999; Severe: TG \>
    1000

- Focus on addressing lifestyle factors and stopping medication that
    increase TG’s (HCTZ, some BB’s, estrogens, some ART, antipsychotics)

- Consider medical therapy when TG\> 500mg/dL (increased risk of
    pancreatitis):

<!-- -->

- Omega-3-fatty acids (icosapent ethyl) 4gms daily or Vascepa 4gm
    daily

- Fibrates: Fenofibrate 120 mg daily (avoid in CKD), Gemfibrozil 600mg
    bid (increased risk of myopathy with concomitant statin)

VA- Specific Guidelines

- <https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/cd/lipids/index.asp>

- Lowest LDL goal recognized for VA Criteria for Use is 100

- Preferred statins: Atorvastatin, Simvastatin, Lovastatin

- Statins that require PADR: Pravastatin, Rosuvastatin (2nd line high
    intensity statin)

<!-- -->

- Must have documented intolerances or drug-drug interaction to all
    preferred statins

<!-- -->

- Other agents that require PADR:

<!-- -->

- Ezetimibe

    - Pt has tried and failed or not tolerated all statins (allergy,
        AE, etc.)

    - Pt not meeting goal on max dose of statin PLUS bile acid
        sequestrants or niacin

- Fenofibrate

    - Pt has tried all formulary alternatives or has contraindication
        to use of formulary alternatives (statin, niacin, gemfibrozil,
        cholestyramine, fish oil)

    - If TG \> 500 mg/dL, fenofibrate should be approved

Hypertension (HTN) – Daniel Motta-Calderon

Background

- Elevated systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure are
    associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk

- HTN is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for premature CVD

Definitions

- ACC/AHA definition of HTN: taking antihypertensive medication or
    having a systolic pressure ≥130 mmHg and/or a diastolic pressure ≥80
    mmHg

- Resistant HTN**:** Uncontrolled BP despite taking 3 antihypertensive
    medications including a diuretic OR 4 total medications

- Whitecoat HTN: Mean BPs lower than threshold of HTN based on
    out-of-office measurements (falsely elevated measurements during
    visits). If SBP \> 130 but \< 160, consider screening for white coat
    HTN with home monitoring

- Masked HTN: Mean BP at/above threshold for hypertension based upon
    out-of-office measurements (falsely decreased measurements during
    visits). If office SBPs consistently 120-129, consider screening for
    masked HTN with home monitoring

    Screening

- Grade A USPTF rec: Screen all adults \>18. Screen adults at least
    semiannually if have risk factors for HTN (obesity, AA), or if
    previously measured SBP 120-129

Diagnosis

- Proper BP measurement:  legs uncrossed, supported arm at level of
    heart, after 5 minutes of rest and with empty bladder; avoid
    caffeine or tobacco 30 minutes prior

- Ideally, primary detection in clinical setting (BP ≥130/80) followed
    by confirmation with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM): 

<!-- -->

- 24hrs mean of systolic ≥125 or diastolic ≥75mmHg 

- Daytime mean systolic ≥130mmHg or diastolic ≥80mmHg  

- Nighttime mean systolic ≥110 mmHg or ≥65 diastolic mmHg 

<!-- -->

- If ABPM not possible, 2-3 outpatient measurements at 1-4 week
    intervals are required to confirm diagnosis  

- BP \>160/100mmHg in the outpatient setting with evidence of
    end-organ damage (ischemic CMP, CVA, hypertensive retinopathy, LV
    hypertrophy, CKD) 

- Any patient presenting with hypertensive emergency or severe
    asymptomatic hypertension (\>180/120mmHg) 

Evaluation

- Assess target organ damage as pertinent: CVA, retinopathy, LV
    hypertrophy/dysfunction, HF, CAD, CKD, PAD.  

<!-- -->

- BMP, CBC, lipid panel, UA, TSH, EKG. Consider additional testing
    including TTE, urine Alb:Cr ratio, or uric acid, ABI 

- Calculate ACSVD 10y risk

<!-- -->

- Distinguish between primary (90% incidence) and secondary HTN
    (10%): 

<!-- -->

- Suspect 1º if gradual onset, family hx, associated with weight gain
    & lifestyle factors 

- Suspect 2º if drug-resistant, abrupt onset, onset \<30yo,
    exacerbation of previously controlled HTN, onset of diastolic
    hypertension in older adults \>65yo, unprovoked or excessive
    hypokalemia

|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Elevated BP                                       | systolic 120-129 mmHg AND diastolic \<80 mmHg | Non-pharmacological interventions and reassess in 3-6 months                                                                      |
| Stage 1                                           | systolic 130-139 mmHg OR diastolic 80-89 mmHg | If 10-y CVD risk ≥10%, non-pharm intervention + BP-lowering medication. Reassess monthly until BP goal met, then every 3-6 months |
| Stage 2                                           | systolic ≥140 mmHg OR diastolic ≥90 mmHg      | Non-pharmacological intervention + BP lowering medication. Reassess monthly until BP goal met, then every 3-6 months              |

Non-pharmacological interventions: regardless of stage  

- 8-14 mmHg ↓: DASH diet (fresh produce, whole grains, low-fat dairy) 

- 5-10 mmHg ↓: Weight loss (10 kg or 22 lbs), expect 1mm Hg for every
    1kg reduction in body weight 

- 3-9 mmHg ↓: Na+ restriction (1.5 g / day), aerobic exercise for
    90-150 min/week, increased intake of K+ rich foods 

- 2-4 mmHg ↓: Moderate EtOH (2 drinks/day for men; 1 drink/day for
    women) 

- Consider deprescribing or switching amphetamines, antidepressants
    (MAOi, SNRIs, TCAs), atypical antipsychotics (clozapine,
    olanzapine), caffeine, decongestants (phenylephrine,
    pseudoephedrine), cyclosporine, oral contraceptives, NSAIDs,
    steroids

Pharmacologic therapy 

- Three main classes of drugs use for initial monotherapy for primary
    hypertension include: ACE-Is/ARBs, CCBs (most frequently a
    dihydropyridine), and thiazide diuretics

- Note that there is wide variability among patients as some will
    respond to one antihypertensive drug but not another

- Black patients often respond best to CCBs or thiazides

- Individualize therapy depending on comorbidities

Asthma – Jared Freitas

Background

- Typically diagnosed in childhood, but occupational asthma,
    aspirin-induced asthma and eosinophilic asthma are more commonly
    diagnosed in adults

- Three most common symptoms: wheezing after trigger, nighttime cough,
    and associated dyspnea

- COPD-asthma overlap syndromes: newer entity that typically involves
    intermittent symptoms

<!-- -->

- Obstruction is present but does not fully resolve with
    bronchodilator

- Consider this diagnosis in a pt w/significant smoking history who is
    dx’d with asthma at age \>40yo

Evaluation

- Ask about triggers: cold, exercise, URIs, allergens, inhaled
    irritants

- Ask about family history or personal history of atopy, eczema,
    allergic rhinitis

- Exam: wheezing, prolonged expiratory phase; nasal polyps, rhinitis,
    eczema

- Spirometry (PFT’s) with reversible obstruction

<!-- -->

- FEV1/FVC \<0.7; \# FEV1 12% and 200 mL after bronchodilator

<!-- -->

- “All That Wheezes Is Not Asthma”. Must rule out alternative
    diagnoses:

<!-- -->

- Panic attacks, upper airway obstruction, foreign body, vocal cord
    dysfunction, CHF (cardiac asthma), COPD, ILD

<!-- -->

- Consider CBC w/diff to screen for significant anemia and
    eosinophilia (associated w/allergic asthma or eosinophilic
    pneumonia)

- If concerned for allergic asthma or allergic bronchopulmonary
    aspergillosis, consider measuring total serum IgE levels

Classify Severity and Assess for Symptom Control with the RULE OF 2s:

- Does the patient have symptoms or require rescue inhaler ≥2 times
    per week?

- Does the patient endorse nighttime symptoms ≥ 2 times per month?

- Does the patient have to refill rescue inhaler ≥ 2 times per year?

- Does the patient ever have to limit activity due to asthma symptoms?

Initial Assessment of Severity:

- Intermittent: No to all of the above and FEV1\> 80% predicted. Start
    at step 1

- Persistent: Yes to any question above. Start at Step 2

<!-- -->

- Mild: Less than daily symptoms, less than weekly nighttime symptoms,
    minor limitation to activities. FEV \>80% predicted

- Moderate: Daily symptoms, weekly nighttime symptoms, some limitation
    to activities. FEV 60-80% predicted

- Severe: More severe symptoms than above, FEV1 \<60% predicted

    - Consider referral to pulmonary

Management

- Aim to use the lowest possible step to maintain symptom control.
    Also consider stepping down therapy if pt has been well-controlled
    for \>3 months

- Prior to escalating therapy, consider:

<!-- -->

- Adherence to therapy (including inhaler technique), uncontrolled
    comorbidities (allergies, GERD, OSA, etc), and alternative diagnoses

- Ensure patients receive MDI and spacer teaching for full effect

<!-- -->

- Updated Guidelines: prn ICS - LABA \> prn SABA Step 1 (mild
    intermittent) and Step 2 (mild persistent)

<!-- -->

- Reduces exacerbations, easier to schedule does in future if needed

- SYGMA Trial showed rescue/prn Budesonide-formoterol (ICS - LABA)
    non-inferior to daily ICS-LABA + prn SABA in preventing
    exacerbations

<!-- -->

- Follow-up

<!-- -->

- Repeat PFTs q3-6 mos after beginning therapy and q1-2 yrs thereafter

- Regular follow up at least q6 mos for all patients with asthma

VA specific guidance: 

- Mometasone is the formulary ICS and Wixela (fluticasone-salmeterol)
    is the formulary ICS/LABA

- Ordering PFTs: Refer to Pulm section on PFTs for VUMC and VA
    specifics

Approach to Outpatient Anxiety/Depression – Kunal Patel

Background

- Anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic
    disorder (PD), agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder (SAD), specific
    phobia

<!-- -->

- Some of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders

- Age of onset varies: SAD (\~teens), PD (\~20s), GAD (broad range,
    incl. \>50)

<!-- -->

- Depression: can refer to a mood state, syndrome, or mental disorder

<!-- -->

- 1-year prevalence of 10%; lifetime prevalence of 21%

- USPTF recommends screening for depression in the general adult
    population

- Average age of onset 30 years

- More common in females (2:1), younger adults, lower income patients,
    and those who are divorced, separated, or widowed

Evaluation

- Anxiety disorders

<!-- -->

- See table for features to elicit in history

- Labs (not all may be necessary): CBC, BMP, TSH, UA, EKG, UDS

<!-- -->

- Major depressive disorder (MDD)

<!-- -->

- See table for features to elicit in history

- Labs (not all may be necessary): CBC, BMP, TSH, RPR, hCG, UDS, B12,
    Folate, EKG

- Determine severity: mild, moderate, severe

    - Degree of functional impairment and disability

Management

- Anxiety

<!-- -->

- Psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy

<!-- -->

- Depression

<!-- -->

- Mild: psychotherapy and symptom monitoring

- Moderate: psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy

- Severe: psych consult, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy

Psychotherapy

- Cognitive behavioral therapy: identifying and modifying negative
    thoughts

- Behavioral activation: scheduling positive activities and increasing
    positive interactions

- Interpersonal psychotherapy: addressing interpersonal issues in
    structured manner

- Find with psychotherapists through VUMC behavioral health referral
    or psychologytoday.com

- VA specific: First refer to PCMHI (teams for same day assessment,
    otherwise consult) and then if needed to BHIP

Pharmacotherapy

- Good starting agents are SSRIs/SNRIs

- Choose based on patient’s specific symptoms, age, adverse effects,
    co-morbidities, and any potential drug-drug interactions

- Typically, start at low doses and titrate up every 2 weeks as needed
    until maximum dose reached

- Full effects not seen until 8-12 weeks, should wait this time before
    switching

- If no response, switch to another SSRI/SNRI

- If partial response, augment

<!-- -->

- Anxiety disorders: buspirone or gabapentin/pregabalin

- MDD: Addition of second agent from different class (e.g. bupropion)

Fatigue – Thomas Horton

Background

- 21-33% of primary care patients describe fatigue as an important
    problem (even if not CC)

- Obtain a thorough history and validate the patient's concerns

<!-- -->

- Assess impact on daily life and accommodations the patient has made
    to cope

<!-- -->

- Description of fatigue: mental vs. physical; sleepiness/tiredness
    vs. "low energy"

- Assess Chronicity: Acute \<1 month; subacute 1-6 months; Chronic \>6
    months

- Review medication list, age -elated cancer screening, prior lab
    values, imaging findings if applicable

- Brief Fatigue Inventory or Fatigue Assessment Scale can be used for
    quantification

Evaluation

- Complete physical exam

- Lab tests to order if \>1 month duration: CMP, CBC w/ diff, HIV,
    Hepatitis B/C, TSH

<!-- -->

- Autoimmune, inflammatory, pregnancy, CK, PPD tests *based on
    clinical context*

<!-- -->

- Assess for mood disorder (PHQ-9; GAD7)

- Assess for sleep disturbance (STOP-BANG, Epworth Sleepiness Scale)

- Age appropriate cancer screening if applicable

- Diagnostic imaging studies based on history and physical exam
    findings

- Screen for domestic violence, housing insecurity, substance use

Management

- Treatment is largely specific to underlying etiology of fatigue (if
    found)

- Etiology may never be identified

<!-- -->

- Consider diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue
    syndrome (ME/CFS) if other causes have been ruled out

<!-- -->

- Continue a supportive relationship with patient

- Consider empiric trial of antidepressant therapy in those with
    residual/idiopathic fatigue with depressed mood even if patient does
    not meet MDD criteria

Chronic Rhinosinusitis – Jared Freitas

Background

- Inflammatory syndrome of the paranasal sinuses, with objective
    evidence of inflammation for \> 12 weeks, typically in young to
    middle aged adults

- Symptoms: typically need two of the following:

<!-- -->

- Anterior/posterior mucopurulent nasal drainage

- Presence of nasal fullness/congestion

- Facial pain/pressure, sometimes accompanied by headache (most
    prevalent but least specific)

- Reduction in sense of smell

<!-- -->

- Red flag symptoms that require more emergent evaluation by ENT or
    NSGY

<!-- -->

- Double vision

- Proptosis

- Ophthalmoplegia

- Severe headache

- Any focal neurologic deficits

<!-- -->

- In addition to clinical history, patients need objective evaluation
    with nasal endoscopy or non-contrasted CT of sinuses (gold standard
    imaging modality) to confirm presence of inflammation and presence
    of nasal polyps

- Other conditions to consider on differential:

<!-- -->

- Rhinitis without sinusitis (vasomotor, gustatory, allergic,
    idiopathic)

- Headache and facial pain syndromes

- Laryngopharyngeal reflux syndrome

Management

- Daily sinus rinses with saline can clear sinuses of secretions,
    irritants and allergens

- Utilizing daily intranasal corticosteroid sprays improve symptoms,
    better control when used in conjunction with sprays

- Short courses of macrolide antibiotics less than 3 weeks duration
    along with short course oral corticosteroids for acute exacerbations

- When to refer to specialist:

<!-- -->

- ENT: Refractory symptoms necessitating rhinoscopy to look for nasal
    polyps, anatomical source of obstruction, ability to get direct
    culture from sinuses, or for sinus surgery as treatment

- Allergy/immunology: treatment of causal allergen or associated
    immunodeficiency that contributes to recurrent infections

<!-- -->

- 10-14 days of oral corticosteroids can also help in patients with
    nasal polyps shrink inflamed tissue and decrease obstructive
    symptoms but require ongoing nasal steroids to prevent recurrence

- Daily antileukotriene agents and antihistamines can provide benefit
    in patients with an allergic component

    Smoking cessation can lead to symptom relief in CRS pts with and w/o
    nasal polyps
