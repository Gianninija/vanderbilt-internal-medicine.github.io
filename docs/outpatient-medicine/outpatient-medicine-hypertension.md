# Hypertension 

Audrey White

---

## Background
-	47% of adults in the US have HTN, yet only 24% of adults with HTN have adequate BP control (2021)
-	HTN is associated with ↑CVD risk and is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for CVD

## Definitions
-	ACC/AHA 2017: BP ≥ 130/80 or taking antihypertensive mediation
-	Resistant HTN: uncontrolled BP despite taking 3 antihypertensive medications (including a diuretic) OR ≥ 4 total medications
-	Whitecoat HTN:  elevated office BP but normal readings when measured  with ambulatory or home blood pressure monitoring (ABPM/HBPM)

## Screening
-	Screen all adults >18. Less frequent screening (q3-5 yrs) is appropriate for adults 18-39 without risk factors and previously normal BP. More frequent screening (q6-12mo) for adults ≥40 or with risk factors (USPSTF Grade A)
-	Risk factors: older age, black race, family history, excess weight/obesity, lifestyle habits (lack of physical activity, stress, tobacco use, alcohol use), dietary factors (high salt or high fat diet)
-	Consider screening for masked HTN with ABPM/HBPM if SBP 120-129 mmHg in office + risk factors (ACC/AHA 2017)
Diagnosis
-	Proper measurement: Avoid caffeine/smoking 30 min prior and empty bladder. Have pt sit quietly at rest for 5 min with legs uncrossed. Place proper sized cuff on exposed arm, supported at heart level.
-	Hypertension by office BP (≥130/80) and hypertension out of office confirmed by ABPM or HBPM, as follows:
    -	Daytime mean: SBP ≥ 130 or DBP ≥ 80
    -	Nighttime mean: SBP ≥ 110 or DBP ≥ 65
    -	24 hr mean: SBP ≥ 125 or DBP ≥ 75 
-	If ABPM not possible, 2-3 outpt measurements at 1-4 week intervals are required to confirm diagnosis  
-	A diagnosis can be made without confirmatory readings in these circumstances
    -	HTN urgency or emergency: SBP ≥ 180 or DBP ≥ 120
    -	Initial SBP ≥ 160 or DBP ≥ 100 and evidence of end-organ damage (LV hypertrophy, HTN retinopathy, ischemic CVD, CKD)

## Evaluation
-	Perform in all pts with newly diagnosed HTN
    -	BMP, fasting glucose, CBC, lipid profile, UA, TSH, EKG
    -	Calculate 10 yr ASCVD risk
-	Distinguish between primary (90% incidence) vs. secondary HTN (10%)
-	Suspect 1º (essential) HTN: gradual onset, family hx, associated risk factors
-	Suspect 2º: unusual presentation (new diagnosis in young/elderly, abrupt, exacerbation in previously controlled HTN), drug-resistant, or the presence of clinical clue (abdominal bruit in renovascular HTN, hypokalemia in hyperaldosteronism)
-	Assess for end organ damage: retinopathy (eye exam), CVD/LV hypertrophy, HF (TTE), CKD (urine Alb:Cr), PAD (ABI)

## Therapy goals 
-	Adults over 60 years: target BP varies by guideline. Consider CVD risk and co-morbidities (e.g., stroke) to decide target BP. 
-	White coat HTN: lifestyle modification & CVD risk reduction
-	Masked HTN: treatment guided by out-of-office BP measurements
-	Diastolic HTN: treat to prevent LVH and HFpEF
-	BP target:
    -	<130/80 mmHg: general population
    -	<140/90 (less aggressive goal): frail pts with orthostatic hypotension, limited life expectancy
-	If not meeting goals, combination therapy > doubling a single agent. Preferred combinations
    -	ACEi/ARB + CCB
    -	ACEi/ARB + CCB + thiazide
    -	ACEi/ARB + CCB + MRA
    -	Do NOT combine BB and non-dihydropyridine CCB

## Non-pharmacological lifestyle interventions: indicated for all pts regardless of stage  
-	8-14 mmHg ↓: DASH diet (fresh produce, whole grains, low-fat dairy) 
-	5-10 mmHg ↓: weight loss (10kg or 22lbs), expect 1 mmHg for every 1kg reduction in body weight 
-	3-9 mmHg ↓: Na+ restriction (1.5g/d), aerobic exercise for 90-150 min/week, increased intake of K+ rich foods 
-	2-4 mmHg ↓: moderate EtOH (2 drinks/day for men; 1 drink/day for women) 
-	Medication changes: consider transitioning offending medications
-	Tobacco cessation: smoking increases risk of masked HTN, renovascular HTN, severe hypertensive retinopathy, and arterial stiffness

## Pharmacologic therapy 
-	Initial monotherapy: ACEi/ARB, dihydropyridine CCB, or thiazides
-	Degree of BP reduction (not type of medication) is the major determinant of CVD risk reduction
-	There is controversial evidence in using race to determine therapy. Some studies suggest the benefit of CCB or thiazides in black pts
