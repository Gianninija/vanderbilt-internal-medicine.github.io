# Asthma

Faria Khimani

---

## Definition 
- Chronic inflammatory bronchial hyperresponsiveness, with episodic exacerbations and reversible airflow obstruction
- Prevalence: 5-10% US population 

## Risk Factors 
- Family history of asthma, history of allergies, atopic dermatitis, low SES 

## Presentation 
- History of cough, recurrent wheezing, recurrent difficulty breathing, recurrent chest tightness 
- Symptoms occur or worsen at night or with exercise, viral infection, exposure to allergens and irritants, changes in weather, hard laughing or crying, stress, or other factors
## Diagnostics 
- First line is spirometry. (do NOT need full PFTs)
- Asthma diagnosis most likely with evidence of obstructive disease AND excessive variability in lung function as measured by:
    - FEV1 reduction w/ FEV1/FVC reduced compared to lower limit of normal (>0.75-0.80 in adults)
    - Positive bronchodilator responsiveness: Increase in FEV1 >12% and >200L 
- Must rule out other common differentials: Panic attacks, upper airway obstruction or infection, foreign body, COPD, ILD, vocal cord dysfunction, CHF, ACE-i induced cough, OSA
- CBC may show eosinophilia
- If concerned for allergic asthma or allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, consider measuring total serum IgE levels 

## Classify Severity and Assess for Symptom Control with the RULE OF 2s  
- Does the pt have symptoms or require rescue inhaler ≥2 times per week?  
- Does the pt endorse nighttime symptoms ≥ 2 times per month?  
- Does the pt use rescue inhaler ≥ 2 times per week?  
- Does the pt ever have to limit activity due to asthma symptoms?

    <th>Impairment over a month</th>
    <th>FEV1</th>

  <tr>
    <td>Intermittent</td>
    <td>No to all the above</td>
    <td>&gt;80% predicted</td>

    <td>Mild persistent</td>
    <td>Symptoms &lt; daily, nighttime symptoms &lt; weekly, SABA use &lt; daily, minor activity limitations</td>

    <td>Moderate persistent</td>
    <td>Symptoms daily, nighttime symptoms ≥ weekly, SABA use daily, some activity limitations</td>
    <td>60-79% predicted</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Severe persistent</td>
    <td>Symptoms all day, nighttime symptoms daily, SABA use &gt; daily, extreme activity limitations</td>
    <td>&lt;60% predicted</td>
  </tr>

## Management 
- Aim to use the lowest possible step to maintain symptom control. Also consider stepping down therapy if pt has been well-controlled for >3 months
- Prior to escalating therapy, consider
    - Adherence to therapy (including inhaler technique), uncontrolled comorbidities (allergies, GERD, OSA, etc), and alternative diagnoses
    - Ensure pts receive MDI and spacer teaching for full effect  
- Updated Guidelines: PRN ICS - LABA > PRN SABA Step 1 (mild intermittent) and Step 2 (mild persistent). Reduces exacerbations, easier to schedule does in future if needed 

## Follow-up 
- Repeat PFTs q3-6 mos after beginning therapy and q1-2 yrs thereafter 
- Follow-up appointment 1-3mos after initiating therapy, every 3-12 mo thereafter 

## VA specific guidance
- Mometasone is the formulary ICS and Wixela (fluticasone-salmeterol) is the formulary ICS/LABA 

## Ordering PFTs
- Refer to Pulm section on PFTs for VUMC and VA specifics
