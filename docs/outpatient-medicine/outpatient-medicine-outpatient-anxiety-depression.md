# Anxiety/Depression 

Lauren Waskowicz

---

## Background 
- Anxiety disorders: spectrum of disorders characterized by excessive fear, anticipatory anxiety of future threat, or avoidance behaviors
    - Includes generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobias, substance-induced anxiety disorder
- Mood disorders:
    - Include major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder (BPD), seasonal affective disorder, dysthymia  

## Presentation  
- MDD: 2+ weeks of ≧ 5/9 SIGECAPS (sleep, interest, guilt, energy, concentration, appetite, psychomotor, suicide), or PHQ-2 screen >2 / PHQ-9 score > 4
- GAD:  6+ months of anxiety and associated restlessness, fatigue, impaired concentration, sleep disturbances (use GAD-7 tool to assess)  

## Evaluation   
- Screen for personal and family history of substance use disorders (often comorbid with mood disorders)
- Screen for family members with MDD/GAD, and if positive, which SSRIs have worked (genetic component of responsiveness)
- Screen for suicidal ideation (“Have you ever had thoughts about wanting to be dead? Not wanting to wake up?”)
    - If “yes,” assess for active/passive (“in the past week, have you had any actual thoughts of killing yourself?”), plan/intent (“do you have a plan to kill yourself and do you have intent to act on them?”)
    - Ask about prior psychiatric hospitalizations
    - Ask about firearms in the house 
- Screen for periods of mania (“have you ever felt like you have needed <3-4 hours a night of sleep?”) as this is a contraindication for SSRIs (below)
- PHQ-9 > 4 abnormal, >9 consider therapy +/- pharmacotherapy

## Management  
- No psychotherapy offered through VUMC.  Counsel to call insurance customer service and ask for in-network counselors accepting new pts. Can also recommend psychology today website (https://www.psychologytoday.com/us) for assistance in finding therapy based on insurance coverage (.PSYCHTODAY)
    - EPIC dot phrase for Nashville therapists (who have accepted OHO pts in the past): .CTLPSY-CHRESOURCES and .LRWPSYCHCOMMUNITY
- Persons in crisis:  for pts expressing active suicidal ideation with intent, can refer to:
    - Centerstone (TN crisis line): *see directory*
    - Mental Health Cooperative (emergency line): *see directory*
- Safety planning via removal of firearms from home
