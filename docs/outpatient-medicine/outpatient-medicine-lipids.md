## Background
-	1º prevention: pts at increased risk who have not yet had a vascular event
-	2º prevention: pts with pre-existing occlusive vascular disease or ASCVD (e.g. stroke, TIA, CAD + angina, ACS, coronary or arterial revascularization, PAD)
-	Screening:  All adults ≥ 20y
    -	USPSTF 2016 Guidelines: q5years for adults 40-75yrs
    -	ACC/AHA 2019 Guideline: adults 20-39 q4-6yrs; <21yrs if strong fam hx; 40-75 “routinely” assess CV risk and calculate ASCVD risk (dot phrase .ASCVD2013)

## Evaluation
-	Fasting not routinely needed unless evaluating for hyperTG; if non-fasting TG >440, then obtain 12-14h fasting panel
-	Consider 2º causes of HLD in initial workup: hypothyroidism, DM, EtOH use, smoking, liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, CKD, meds (e.g. thiazide, glucocorticoids)
-	In pts with borderline ASCVD risk (5%-7.5% risk) or hesitant to take statins with low risk, CAC score can help with shared decision making. Therapy is recommended.
-	Check lipoprotein(a) (once in a lifetime) in pts with personal or family history of ASCVD, or in pts with less than expected LDL lowering after starting a statin.
Management
-	Lifestyle changes: weight loss, exercise, smoking cessation, limiting alcohol
    -	Diet low in sat. fat a/w 15-20 mg/dL ↓ in LDL-C, ~50% ↓risk of CAD
    -	Diet Avoiding: trans/saturated fats (red meat, processed meat, butter, cheese), sodium (<2300 mg/day) and sugar-sweetened foods and beverages
    -	Diet Emphasizing: vegetables, fruits, legumes, lean protein, whole grains, nuts

## Statin Therapy
-	Check AST/ALT prior to initiation
-	Note that ASCVD risk equation is best validated for non-Hispanic whites and blacks. Consider use of additional risk prediction tools/factors in other pt populations
-	Lipid panel should be checked 6-8 weeks following initial statin to ensure LDL-C has fallen 30-50%. After this, consider checking lipid panel yearly to assess adherence.

## Statin Side effects: 
-	Spectrum of statin associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) include myalgias, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, autoimmune myopathy
    -	Myalgias: bilateral involving large muscle groups, onset within weeks of initiation of therapy and should resolve within weeks of cessation; CK should be normal
    -	Consider evaluation with CK, BMP, TSH, and vitamin D
    -	"ACC Statin Intolerance Calculator” can help assess etiology of symptoms

## Additional Information
-	If pt is not tolerating a statin, consider
    -	Holding statin until symptoms resolve and trialing lower dose or other statin
    -	Every other day dosing with rosuvastatin (longer half-life and hydrophilic)
    -	If repeated failed attempts, consider ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitor 
-	Consider adding ezetimibe if pt has very high ASCVD and LDL >70 while on maximally tolerated high-intensity statin
-	PCSK9 inhibitor requires referral to Lipid Clinic

## Hypertriglyceridemia
-	Moderate: TG 175-499 mg/dL; Moderate-severe 500 - 999; Severe: TG > 1000
-	Focus on addressing lifestyle factors and stopping medication that increase TG’s (HCTZ, some BB’s, estrogens, some ART, antipsychotics)
-	Consider medical therapy when TG> 500mg/dL  (increased risk of pancreatitis)
    -	Omega-3-fatty acids (icosapent ethyl) 4gms daily or Vascepa 4gm daily
    -	Fibrates: fenofibrate 120 mg daily (avoid in CKD), gemfibrozil 600mg BID (increased risk of myopathy with concomitant statin)

## VA- Specific Guidelines
- https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/cd/lipids/index.asp
-	Lowest LDL goal recognized for VA Criteria for Use is 100 
-	Preferred statins: atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin
-	Statins that require PADR: pravastatin, rosuvastatin (2nd-line high-intensity statin)
    -	Must have documented intolerances or DDI to all preferred statins
-	Other agents that require PADR
    -	Ezetimibe
        -	Pt has tried and failed or not tolerated all statins (allergy, AE, etc.)
        -	Pt not meeting goal on max dose of statin PLUS bile acid sequestrants or niacin
    - Fenofibrate
        - Pt has tried all formulary alternatives or has contraindication to use of formulary alternatives (statin, niacin, gemfibrozil, cholestyramine, fish oil)
        - If TG > 500 mg/dL, fenofibrate should be approved
