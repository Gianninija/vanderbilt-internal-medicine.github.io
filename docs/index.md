# Dedication

The authors and editors dedicate the fourth edition of the Housestaff
Handbook to the memory of Dr. Michael Fowler, whose compassion,
sincerity, and commitment to education continue to guide and inspire
us. 

Michael J. Fowler, MD, Associate Professor of Medicine and Associate
Professor, Office of Teaching and Learning in Medicine in the Vanderbilt
University School of Medicine, was an inspiring teacher and educator, an
outstanding physician, and a wonderful colleague who passed away on
February 20, 2022. As a Master Clinical Teacher at Vanderbilt, Mike was
the Course Director for Physical Diagnosis and taught physical diagnosis
to more than 1500 Vanderbilt medical students. As Co-director of the
Shade Tree Clinic, he touched the lives of many patients and inspired
Vanderbilt medical students to understand how to be a physician who
cared for the entire patient. He was a wonderful, passionate teacher and
advocate for all students in the clinical setting, in the classroom and
in life, and touched many, many people with his kindness, humor,
intellect, humility, and medical and teaching skills.
