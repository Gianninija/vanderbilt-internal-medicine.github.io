Cirrhosis Overview – Lee Richardson, Hannah Angle

Background

- Standard 1-liner for any patient with cirrhosis:

<!-- -->

- Example 1-liner: 65yo M with cirrhosis due to HCV decompensated by
    ascites and HE (MELD 25) who is listed for transplant and followed
    by Dr. Izzy

<!-- -->

- Etiology of cirrhosis: HCV\>HBV, EtOH, NASH, Wilson’s,
    hemochromatosis, A1AT deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, PSC, PBC,
    congestive hepatopathy (right heart failure), medication-induced

- Complications that cause decompensation: overt ascites (or hepatic
    hydrothorax), overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE), esophageal variceal
    hemorrhage (EVH)

- Always calculate daily MELD-Na scores (predicts 3 mo survival based
    on Tbili, Cr, INR, Na)

Evaluation

- Goals: establish cause of cirrhosis, evaluate for complications and
    treat accordingly, determine prognosis, and consider transplant
    evaluation

<!-- -->

- History:

<!-- -->

- Symptoms suggesting decompensation: confusion, sleep disturbances,
    abdominal swelling, lower extremity edema, scleral icterus/jaundice,
    pruritus, easy bruising/bleeding (skin, mouth, GI tract), dyspnea

- Social history: EtOH and drug use hx, date of last drink, average \#
    of drinks/day, duration of EtOH use, prior rehab, hx of DUI, if
    there has been continued EtOH use despite knowledge of liver
    disease; these factors all impact transplant candidacy

- Ascites: compliance with diuretics, compliance with salt
    restriction, frequency of paracentesis (volume removed, date of last
    para), h/o SBP

- HE: compliance with lactulose, \# of BMs per day, any potential
    triggers (see HE section)

- GIB/EVH: hematemesis, coffee ground emesis, melena, hematochezia
    (duration, volume, \# of bleeding episodes), last EGD (varices,
    banding) and colonoscopy, compliance with non-selective BBs

<!-- -->

- Physical exam: asterixis, ascites, edema/anasarca, splenomegaly,
    muscle wasting, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, palmar erythema,
    spider angiomata, scleral icterus/jaundice, petechiae/ecchymoses,
    caput medusa, Terry’s nails

- Labs

<!-- -->

- Initial Workup: CMP, CBC, coags, UA, HCV/HBV, Fe studies, PEth

- Unless requested by hepatology, defer to outpatient: AFP, ANA, IgG,
    A1AT, ceruloplasmin, AMA (PBC), ASMA (AIH), anti-SLA (AIH), anti-LKM
    (AIH)

<!-- -->

- Imaging:

<!-- -->

- Abdominal US with duplex unless done in past 6 months or indication
    for repeating sooner (concern for new portal vein thrombosis)

- For transplant eval, needs triple phase CT A/P (contrasted study,
    arterial and venous phases) or MRI abdomen with contrast

<!-- -->

- Liver biopsy: gold standard for cirrhosis diagnosis but is not
    always needed if clinical presentation, labs, and imaging consistent
    with cirrhosis

Lab abnormalities

- Hyponatremia (see hyponatremia section below)

- Cirrhotic coagulopathy (increased INR): due to ↓ coagulation factor
    production

- Thrombocytopenia: due to splenic sequestration, ↓ TPO production

- Hypoalbuminemia: indications for 25% albumin transfusion – SBP
    (1.5g/kg on day 1, 1g/kg on day 3), LVP (6-8g/L of ascites), HRS
    (albumin challenge: 1g/kg/day with max 100 g/day x 2 days), hypoNa
    \<125 and refractory to fluid restriction

Management

- Nutrition: high protein diet, 2g Na restriction (if ascites
    present),

<!-- -->

- Consider MVI, folate, thiamine (particularly in pts with EtOH use
    disorder)

- Mediterranean diet for NASH

- Fluid restriction if hyponatremic

<!-- -->

- Immunizations: ensure up-to-date with HBV/HAV, PPSV23, Prevnar, Flu,
    COVID-19 vaccines

- Consider consulting Addiction Psych and Social Work for pts with
    EtOH use disorder - can assist with arranging Intensive Outpatient
    Program (IOP), Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)

- General screenings include: HCC screening (q6 months), EVH screening
    (see section below), monitor for other decompensations and treat
    accordingly, monitor MELD and consider transplant evaluation when
    \>15

- Refer to hepatology outpatient

Medication Tips:

- Pain: 2g limit Tylenol, No NSAIDs, limit sedating medications
    especially with HE.

<!-- -->

- Tramadol 25-50mg generally safe to use

<!-- -->

- Pruritus: Sarna lotion, can spot dose antihistamines. Can discuss
    with pharmacist/attending about starting sertraline, cholestyramine
    (interacts with many medications), or rifampin.

- Anxiety/insomnia: hydroxyzine, avoid benzodiazepines

- If needed for EtOH withdrawal, use lorazepam (Ativan) instead of
    chlordiazepoxide (Librium) or diazepam (Valium) due to its shorter
    half life

Liver Transplant (LT) Workup – Lauren Evers Carlini

Background

- Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD-Na) score: initially
    developed to predict survival following TIPS placement, though is
    now used to objectively rank patients in terms of priority for liver
    transplant (LT)

<!-- -->

- Factors in total bilirubin, creatinine, INR, and Na.

- Exception points given for complications like HCC and
    hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), leading to score in mid to high 20’s
    even if biologic MELD is low

- Highest score lasts for 7 days

<!-- -->

- Listing a pt for LT is determined by a multidisciplinary transplant
    committee

<!-- -->

- Acute liver failure pts take precedence over decompensated cirrhosis
    pts for LT

Evaluation

- Abdominal CT (triple phase) or MRI (multiphase with contrast) to
    evaluate for hepatic malignancy and vascular anatomy

- Infectious workup: TB testing, HIV, RPR, VZV, CMV, EBV, and
    Hepatitis A, B, and C

- Cardiac evaluation: EKG and TTE with bubble are required. Functional
    testing: CT coronaries with fractional flow, invasive angiography
    and intervention may be necessary depending on pre-test probability.

- PFT’s, carotid ultrasound, panorex, etc.

- Appropriate cancer screenings (colonoscopy, pap smear, mammogram,
    and PSA if applicable)

- DEXA scan

- Certification of completion of intensive outpatient program (IOP)
    for substance abuse

- Evaluation by hepatobiliary surgical team after obtaining cross
    sectional imaging

- Psychosocial evaluation (consult Psychiatry, social work)

- Current VUMC policy: pts should be abstinent from alcohol for no
    less than 3-6 months, although exceptions may be made for early
    liver transplant based on a very strict protocol. Discuss exception
    criteria with attending if suspect patient unlikely to survive
    hospitalization without transplant

Both living and deceased donor transplant are offered at VUMC. Donor
evaluation, however, cannot be started before the potential recipient is
deemed a candidate.

Ascites and Hepatic Hydrothorax – Lauren Evers Carlini, Thomas Strobel

Ascites

Background

- Associated with a reduction in 5 year survival from 80% to 30%.

- Most often due to portal hypertension. Less common causes include
    peritoneal or metastatic cancer, heart failure, tuberculosis,
    nephrotic syndrome, Budd-Chiari, sinusoidal obstructive syndrome
    (S.O.S), or complications from procedures and pancreatitis

| Grade           | Definition                               | Treatment                                           |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Grade 1 Ascites | Only seen on imaging                     | 2g Na restriction                                   |
| Grade 2 Ascites | Moderate, symmetric abdominal distension | 2g Na restriction, diuretics                        |
| Grade 3 Ascites | Marked, tense abdominal distension       | LVP + Na restriction, diuretics (unless refractory) |

Evaluation

- Bedside ultrasound on admission to confirm presence of ascites

- Diagnostic paracentesis in all pts with ascites on admission mainly
    to rule out occult SBP

<!-- -->

- Initial paracentesis or when cause of ascites is uncertain: Total
    Protein, serum and BF Albumin, cell count w/diff, culture

- Subsequent/Serial paracenteses: cell count w/diff, culture, protein

- Always inoculate culture bottles at bedside

<!-- -->

- There is no guideline for INR cutoff for paracentesis, although our
    procedure team often looks for INR \< 3.5 (IR usually doesn’t care
    about INR)

- Serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) = serum albumin - ascites
    albumin.

- Calculate PMNs from fluid (see SBP below)

- Other tests:

<!-- -->

- Triglycerides: if fluid is milky

- Cytology: if very concerned for peritoneal carcinomatosis. May need
    up to 3 separate samples (50ml or more) to be able to detect
    malignant cells

- ADA: if concern for peritoneal TB

- Hematocrit: For bloody appearing fluid (not just serosanguinous) to
    rule out hemoperitoneum. There needs to be a recent serum HCT for
    comparison.

- Amylase: If concerned for pancreatic ascites

- Glucose, LDH if concern about secondary peritonitis (see below)

Management

- 2000mg sodium restriction per day for all ascites (Grade 1-3)

- Diuretics (spironolactone and typically furosemide)

<!-- -->

- Start at 100mg of spironolactone with up titration to 400mg

- Furosemide is added if insufficient diuresis or if limited by
    hyperkalemia. Use more loop diuretics in patients with CKD.

- If Urine Na:K ratio \<1, indicates insufficient natriuresis. Can ↑
    doses to a max of 400:160

- If poor response can change to torsemide 10mg and ↑ to 40mg max (per
    single dose)

- Fluid restriction usually not necessary unless serum sodium \<125
    mmol/L

<!-- -->

- Large volume paracentesis should be performed for tense ascites or
    refractory ascites (grade 3), regardless of serum Cr. Pts should be
    tapped dry with each paracentesis

- Give 6-8g of albumin per liter of ascites removed, even if \< 5L

- Target weight loss of 0.5 kg/day when diuresing to avoid renal
    injury

- Discontinue NSAIDs and ACEI/ARB

Refractory Ascites:

- Two distinctions:

<!-- -->

- Diuretic-resistant: lack of response to diuretics (max
    spironolactone 400mg/lasix 160mg), Na restriction and rapid
    recurrence following paracentesis

- Diuretic-intractable: unable to tolerate diuretic therapy 2/2
    adverse drug effects (unexplained HE, AKI, K abnormalities, hypoNa,
    intractable muscle cramps)

<!-- -->

- Management aside from liver transplant:

<!-- -->

- Discontinue diuretics once refractory ascites has been established

- Consider oral midodrine; can be especially helpful if pt is also
    hypotensive

- Serial paracenteses, generally arranged OP with IR

- Consider TIPS (trans jugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt; has
    survival benefit). Following TIPS, cessation or decrease in ascites
    should occur in 4-6 weeks

- Consider discontinuing beta blockers in patients with refractory
    ascites if sBP \<90, SCr \>1.5, or Na \<130

Hepatic Hydrothorax

Background

- Transudative effusion, typically unilateral (75% right sided);
    reflects ascitic fluid that passes through defects in the diaphragm.
    10% can develop without clinical ascites.

- Present in 4-12% of cirrhotics and portends a poor prognosis (75%
    mortality within 90 days)

Evaluation

- Often suspected clinically, though must exclude
    pleural/cardiopulmonary process

- Thoracentesis will demonstrate a transudative effusion and should be
    evaluated with standard pleural fluid lab tests: cell count,
    protein, albumin, LDH, culture

<!-- -->

- Other considerations: triglycerides, amylase, hematocrit, cytology

<!-- -->

- Rule out SBE which is diagnosed the same as SBP (PMN\>250)

Management

- Similar management of ascites as noted above

- AVOID chest-tube placement. Associated with increased morbidity and
    mortality due to extensive loss of fluid, electrolytes and protein
    as well as increased infection risk

<!-- -->

- PleurX catheters can be considered for palliation (e.g., hospice
    patients)

<!-- -->

- Refractory Hydrothorax is defined similarly and managed similarly
    with serial thoracentesis or TIPS. For those who are not candidates,
    consider:

<!-- -->

- Chemical pleurodesis (not commonly performed at VUMC due to
    complications)

- Thoracoscopic mesh repair in pts with clear diaphragmatic deficits
    (not common practice at VUMC )

<!-- -->

- Management of spontaneous bacterial empyema is the same as in SBP
    (see below)

Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) – Patricia Checinski

Background

- Infection of ascitic fluid without evidence of a surgical
    intra-abdominal source

- Presentation: fever, abdominal pain, encephalopathy, renal failure,
    acidosis, and/or leukocytosis

Evaluation

- Any pt with cirrhosis and ascites who is admitted should have
    diagnostic paracentesis to rule out SBP. Delaying paracentesis \> 12
    hours is associated with a 2.7-fold increase in mortality.

- Obtain cell count with diff.

<!-- -->

- Calculate the PMNs: total nucleated cells x % neutrophils.

- PMNs \> 250 cells is diagnostic of SBP. If there are greater than
    100k RBCs, you should correct for them: for every 250 RBCs, subtract
    1 PMN

<!-- -->

- A positive ascitic bacterial culture with PMN \<250 is called
    bacterascites and asymptomatic patients should NOT receive
    antibiotics. You will also frequently see culture-negative SBP
    (neutrocytic ascites) which SHOULD be treated (see below).

Management

- Immediately start empiric antibiotics

<!-- -->

- Guidelines recommend cefotaxime IV 2gm q8 hours x 5 days, but we
    commonly use ceftriaxone IV 2g q24h for 5-7 days at VUMC and
    Nashville VA.

    - Most common culprits (E. coli, Klebsiella, streptococcal
        species, staphylococcal species)

    - If SBP developed with recent hospital admission (90 days),
        recent exposure to BSA, diagnosed \>48 hours of admission, or
        with sepsis, consider zosyn or meropenem to cover MDROs

<!-- -->

- IV albumin 1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1g/kg on day 3

- Discontinue beta-blockers once SBP develops and do not restart until
    SBP is completely treated, Na \>130, and no AKI

- PPI’s ↑ risk for SBP in pts with cirrhosis, and should be reviewed
    for appropriateness

- Repeat diagnostic paracentesis two days after antibiotics initiated

<!-- -->

- If \<25% decrease in PMNs, antibiotics should be broadened. Consider
    secondary bacterial peritonitis

Prophylaxis

- GI bleed: ceftriaxone 1g daily ciprofloxacin 500mg BID (preferred)
    or Bactrim one DS tablet BID x 5-7 days

- Outpatient lifelong ppx:

<!-- -->

- Indicated for:

    - Prior SBP

    - Ascitic protein \<1.5 AND

        - Child Pugh \>9 and bilirubin \>3 OR

        - Renal dysfunction (Cr \>1.2, Na \<130, or BUN \>25)

- Preferred: Bactrim DS tab daily or ciprofloxacin 500mg daily

- Alternatives: cefdinir 300mg daily, Augmentin 875/125 daily

If suspicion is high for secondary bacterial peritonitis:

- Examine serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). SBP develops in pts
    with portal hypertension, defined by SAAG \> 1.1 g/dL. SBP is
    unlikely if SAAG is \< 1.1 g/dL.

- While not particularly sensitive, an ascitic leukocyte count of
    5-10k should prompt consideration of secondary peritonitis

- Amylase from fluid can also be helpful to point towards pancreatic
    ascites, while bilirubin can indicate gallbladder perforation.
    Peritoneal fluid CEA and alkaline phosphatase can additionally help
    identify hollow viscus injury.

- Evaluate with cross-sectional imaging and surgical consultation as
    appropriate

- Runyon’s Criteria to distinguish, requires 2/3 criteria below
    (protein, glucose, LDH)

|                 | Spontaneous          | Secondary     |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Protein (g/dL)  | \< 1                 | \> 1          |
| Glucose (mg/dL) | ≥50                  | \< 50         |
| LDH (U)         | Elevated, but \< 225 | \> 225        |
| Organisms       | 0-1                  | Polymicrobial |

Gastroesophageal Varices and Hemorrhage – Patricia Checinski

Background

- Varices form due to portosystemic collaterals in the setting of
    portal HTN

- The risk of mortality with each episode of esophageal variceal
    hemorrhage (EVH) is 15-25%

- Recurrence occurs in 60% of patients within 1-2 years of the index
    event

Variceal Screening

- Not all pts with cirrhosis require screening. Can be omitted without
    clinically significant portal hypertension (e.g. low liver stiffness
    (on elastography) and platelets \>150) or if pt already on
    non-selective beta blocker (NSBB) with HR 55-60

- Compensated cirrhosis without varices: EGD q3yr, unless active liver
    injury (obesity, EtOH use, ongoing viral infxn), then q2yr

- Compensated cirrhosis with small varices: EGD q2yr unless active
    liver injury, then q1yr

- Decompensated cirrhosis with no or small nonbleeding varices: EGD
    q1yr, and at initial time of decompensation

Management (Non-Bleeding Varices)

- Primary ppx with either NSBB (preferred) or endoscopic band ligation
    (EBL)

<!-- -->

- Nadolol (given nightly as portal pressures are highest at night) or
    propranolol (BID)

- Carvedilol has greater portal pressures and may be preferred if
    tolerated (goal 6.25mg BID)

- For 2 º ppx, initiate \~72hr after acute bleed has resolved and
    octreotide discontinued

- Discontinue if: hypotension (sBP \<90), AKI, SBP or hyponatremia
    with refractory ascites

<!-- -->

- Secondary ppx with both NSBB and EBL.

<!-- -->

- NSBB are associated with reduced mortality, while EBL is not

Management (Bleeding Varices)

- Place two large-bore IVs (18G or larger), resuscitate with blood
    products and albumin. Activate massive transfusion protocol if
    needed.

- Consider intubation if need for emergent EGD, change in mental
    status, ongoing hematemesis, concern of ability to protect airway

- Start octreotide 50 mcg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion of
    50 mcg/h, to be continued for at least 2 days should EVH be
    confirmed on endoscopy

- Ceftriaxone 1g IV q24h for SBP prophylaxis (reduced mortality), then
    transition to PO ciprofloxacin for total 7-day course

- Consult GI for upper endoscopy. Endoscopic therapies performed
    include variceal band ligation and sclerotherapy.

- Consider balloon tamponade with Blakemore as temporizing measure
    before definitive management. Patient must be intubated before
    placement, and preferably GI should be made aware prior to
    placement.

- No role for the correction of INR, even in the presence of bleeding
    as excessive blood products and FFP can increase portal pressures
    and cause worsening bleeding

<!-- -->

- Vitamin K can be given w/ ↑ INR, though is unlikely to help in the
    acute setting

- Check TEG and fibrinogen and transfuse based on results

- AASLD does not recommend specific platelet targets during variceal
    hemorrhage

- Administer blood products in balanced ratio to avoid transfusion
    related coagulopathy (VUMC MTP is 6:4:1 of RBC:FFP:PLT)

Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE)

Evaluation

- Asterixis: inability to maintain stable posture; many ways to assess

<!-- -->

- Check for clonus

- Have pt “hold out hands like you are stopping traffic” (if following
    commands)

- Shine light in pupil (look up video of hippus)

- Identify precipitants

<!-- -->

- Infection (rule out SBP in addition to CXR, BCx, UA/Cx),

- Medication non-adherence (lactulose)

- GI bleed (perform rectal exam and observe Hgb trend)

- Over-diuresis resulting in dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities
    (especially hypoK)

- Sedatives/benzo/opiate administration (UDS)

<!-- -->

- Ammonia (NH3) levels do not play a role in the acute management of
    HE

- Arterial NH3 is used in acute liver failure for prognostication (not
    for management)

Management

- Always determine precipitant and treat underlying condition

- Lactulose 30mL TID initially

<!-- -->

- Titrate dose to at least 4 BMs daily, avoid excessive stool output
    which may exacerbate HE due to dehydration and electrolyte
    abnormalities

- Consider lactulose enemas vs DHT placement if pt unable to tolerate
    PO

    - DHT are not contraindicated in patients with esophageal varices,
        but should be avoided in patients with recent hemorrhage or
        banding

- Add Rifaximin after the second episode of HE, or if failure to
    respond to lactulose

    - Frequently requires prior authorization for outpatient approval
        and is expensive

<!-- -->

- Lactulose is generally continued indefinitely after first episode of
    HE, though discontinuation can be considered if predisposing factors
    (recurrent infection, EVH, EtOH use) have resolved

AKI & Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS) – Garren Montgomery

Background

- Portal HTN causes shear stress on portal vessels endothelium release
    of vasodilators splanchnic vasodilation and reduced effective blood
    volume (decreased MAP) RAAS activation sodium and water retention
    and severe renal vasoconstriction

- Bacterial translocation (as seen in SBP) increased circulating
    pro-inflammatory cytokines splanchnic vasodilation

- Definitions:

<!-- -->

- HRS-AKI (formerly type I HRS): Rise in Cr ≥0.3 within 48h, rise in
    Cr ≥50% within 7 days, OR UOP \<0.5 mL/kg/hr for 6 hours

- HRS-NAKI (“non-AKI”) (formerly type II HRS):

    - HRS-AKD: eGFR\<60 for \<3 months in absence of other structural
        causes OR % rise in Cr ≤50% using last available Cr over last 3
        months as baseline

    - HRS-CKD: eGFR\<60 for ≥3 months in absence of other structural
        causes

<!-- -->

- Diagnostic Criteria

<!-- -->

- Diagnosis of AKI (see above) without other cause (see below)

- No response or inadequate response at 48 hrs after volume expansion
    with albumin and withdrawal of diuretics

- Absence of proteinuria (\<500 mg/d), absence of hematuria (\<50 RBCs
    per HPF), normal renal ultrasound (exclude if patient has known CKD)

- Suggestion of renal vasoconstriction with FeNa \<0.2, FeUrea \<20
    (most sensitive diagnostic measure). UNa \<20 is suggestive but not
    diagnostic given baseline sodium avidity in cirrhosis and inability
    to calculate FeNa

- Cut off for ATN in cirrhosis is a FeNa \>0.5, rather than 1 in the
    general population

Evaluation

- Step 1: Exclude other obvious causes of renal injury such as
    hypovolemia or ATN

<!-- -->

- Common precipitants of AKI: infection, overdiuresis, GI bleeding,
    recent LVP without subsequent volume expansion, nephrotoxic
    drugs/NSAIDs

- Workup: BMP, UA with microscopy, urine electrolytes (FeNa, FeUrea),
    urine protein/Cr ratio, renal ultrasound (to assess for chronicity),
    diagnostic para to rule out SBP

<!-- -->

- Step 2: Diuretic cessation/albumin challenge

<!-- -->

- STOP all diuretics, beta blockers, NSAIDs, ACE/ARBs,
    anti-hypertensives, vasodilators, nephrotoxins

- START volume expansion with albumin 1g/kg/day (up to a max of 100
    g/day) x2 days

<!-- -->

- Step 3: Diagnosis of HRS

<!-- -->

- If no other clear cause of AKI is identified and SCr has not
    improved after 48 hours of diuretic cessation and volume expansion,
    proceed promptly to vasopressor treatment

Management

- Pharmacologic therapies (in order of preference):

<!-- -->

- Terlipressin + albumin. Most effective combo based on clinical
    trials, NOW AVAILABLE (ongoing clinical trial at VUMC)

- Norepinephrine + albumin (25-50 g/day)

    - Most likely to be used at VUMC, requires central access (PICC vs
        triple lumen) but can be administered on stepdown unit

    - Guidelines recommend NE to be dosed at 0.5-3 mg/hr. Would ask
        fellow, attending or pharmacist for baseline. VUMC protocol for
        ICU and stepdown:

        - Start NE gtt at 3mcg/min. If UOP is \<200 or MAP \<10mm Hg
            from baseline, increase by 3 mcg/min every 4 hours

<!-- -->

- Continue to hold diuretics. LVP is still generally considered safe
    even in HRS if indicated by tense ascites (account for albumin
    repletion from LVP and HRS protocol). This can be attending specific
    and would confirm prior to performing

- Therapy is generally continued until HRS is reversed or the
    hepatology attending deems it refractory to medical treatment

- Patients with HRS-NAKI (formerly type II HRS) may respond to the
    above therapies, but recurrence of renal dysfunction after
    withdrawal of vasoconstrictors is the norm and thus current
    guidelines do not recommend them for this scenario

- RRT: Dialysis can be considered for those who fail to respond to
    pharmacologic therapy, particularly ONLY as a bridge to liver
    transplant. Decision to initiate should be individualized

- Liver transplant: The best and most definitive treatment regardless
    of response to pharmacologic therapy

    Simultaneous liver-kidney transplant:

- HRS often resolves with LT alone. Indications for kidney transplant
    are usually for patients with severe chronic renal dysfunction or on
    RRT. Must consult transplant nephrology.

- Criteria for SLKT:

<!-- -->

- eGFR \<60 for \>30 days AND latest eGFR \<30

- eGFR \<25 for \>6 consecutive weeks with a documented eGFR q7 days

- Metabolic syndromes and polycystic disease

<!-- -->

- Can qualify for safety net kidney transplant after liver transplant
    if eGFR \<20 2-12 months post-operatively (would be at higher
    priority than the rest of the kidney transplant list)

Hyponatremia in Cirrhosis – John Laurenzano

Background 

- Most commonly is hypervolemic hyponatremia, driven by release of ADH
    from decreased effective arterial blood volume (EABV) in the setting
    of portal hypertension

- Hyponatremia in cirrhosis is a marker of advanced disease and is
    associated with higher rates of SBP, HE, HRS, and mortality. 

Evaluation 

- Standard evaluation of hyponatremia, including Uosm, Sosm, UNa to
    rule out competing processes (e.g. beer potomania) 

Management 

- Discontinue anti-hypertensives (including beta blockers) in patients
    with ascites and hyponatremia. Hold diuretics when Na \<125 

- Fluid restriction is recommended only in patients with Na \<125.
    Restriction is generally effective at 1-1.5L and must be less than
    daily urine output to increase free water excretion 

- Replete potassium to 4.0, as potassium is as osmotically active and
    results in shifts in extra and intracellular fluids which lead to a
    net increase in serum sodium. 

- 25% albumin infusion (1g/kg split into BID dosing), has been shown
    to increase serum sodium and have higher rates of hyponatremia
    resolution at 30 days 

- Other treatment considerations include vasopressors, vaptans, urea
    tabs

- Salt tabs should not be used to raise serum Na due to worsening
    hypervolemia

- Nephrology should be consulted if not improved after 48 hours

Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) – Pakinam Mekki

Background

- A Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt or TIPS procedure is
    done by interventional radiology to manage sequelae of portal
    hypertension (specifically variceal bleeding and ascites)

- A low-resistance shunt is created between an intrahepatic branch of
    the portal vein and the hepatic vein, allowing blood to bypass the
    high-resistance vessels within the fibrotic liver

Evaluation

- Indications for TIPS

<!-- -->

- Variceal hemorrhage (esophageal, gastric, etc.)

    - Early “preemptive” TIPS is an urgent TIPS placement within 72
        hrs (preferably within 24 hours) of initial endoscopic
        hemostasis in pts at high risk for rebleeding (Child-Pugh Class
        B with active bleeding upon insertion of endoscope or Child-Pugh
        Class C with recent bleeding

    - “Rescue” TIPS is placed in pts with active, uncontrolled
        variceal bleeding or if bleeding recurs despite maximal
        endoscopic and pharmacologic therapy

- Refractory ascites (prolongs survival)

- Other: portal hypertensive gastropathy, PVT recanalization,
    Budd-Chiari syndrome, hepatic hydrothorax

<!-- -->

- Contraindications to TIPS

<!-- -->

- Absolute contraindications

    - Primary prevention of variceal bleeding, congestive heart
        failure, severe tricuspid regurgitation, severe pulmonary
        hypertension, multiple hepatic cysts or masses, Sepsis,
        unrelieved biliary obstruction

- Relative contraindications

    - Hepatic encephalopathy, hepatic tumors (especially if centrally
        located), thrombocytopenia, moderate pulmonary hypertension

<!-- -->

- Pre-procedure preparation

<!-- -->

- Labs: CBC, CMP, INR

- Liver imaging to assess portal system patency and exclude liver
    masses

    - Ideally triple phase CT with contrast

    - In pts with renal impairment or active variceal bleeding, RUQ
        U/S with doppler is acceptable

- TTE to evaluate for evidence of congestive heart failure, pulmonary
    hypertension, or valvular disease.

- Antibiotic ppx with ceftriaxone 1g IV once at the time of TIPS
    insertion as enteric bacteria within the static portal system can
    enter systemic circulation

- Patients with HE should receive rifaximin prophylaxis starting 2
    weeks before procedure

Management Post-TIPS

- Immediately following TIPS, pts are observed in the hospital
    overnight for complications

<!-- -->

- Monitor CBC and vitals closely. If hemodynamically unstable, STAT
    CBC and low threshold to obtain CTA A/P to evaluate for a bleeding
    source

<!-- -->

- TIPS causes a substantial increase in venous return to the heart,
    which can unmask cardiac dysfunction that was previously compensated
    for

- Obtain RUQ U/S with Doppler to assess shunt patency 1 month of TIPS
    placement, or if ascites and/or variceal hemorrhage reoccur

- If patient with a TIPS develops refractory HE, can consider TIPS
    revision to lessen HE symptoms

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) – Lee Richardson, Julie Cui

Background

- Pts with HCV cirrhosis are at greatest risk (incidence 2-4% per
    year)

- In chronic HBV and NASH, pts can develop HCC without having
    cirrhosis

Evaluation

- Regular screening in pts with cirrhosis (or chronic HBV without
    cirrhosis) for HCC

<!-- -->

- RUQ U/S q6mo (with or without AFP)

- Routine screening with CT or MRI is not recommended

<!-- -->

- Options If U/S not satisfactory:

<!-- -->

- CT A/P w/contrast, in comments specify triple phase for HCC
    screening

- MRI, specify Gadovist (preferred contrast agent)

- Contrast-enhanced ultrasound

<!-- -->

- AFP trend is more useful than one value in time, though AFP \>20
    should prompt multiphase CT or MRI for further evaluation

- Diagnosis can be made either by imaging (most common) or biopsy
    (rare)

<!-- -->

- Triple phase CT demonstrates strong early uptake in arterial phase,
    with subsequent wash-out in portal-venous phase

- If diagnosis remains unclear: can surveillance imaging or biopsy

- LI-RADS system notes risk of malignancy based on imaging
    characteristics

| LI-RADS      | What does it mean?         | What do we do?                                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LR-1 to LR-2 | Definitely/probably benign | Routine surveillance, consider diagnostic imaging within 6 mos                 |
| LR-3 to LR-4 | Indeterminate/probably HCC | Repeat or alternative diagnostic imaging in 3-6 mos. Consider Bx for LI-RADS 4 |
| LR-5         | Definitely HCC             | Plan treatment as noted below                                                  |
| LR-M         | Cancer, but may not be HCC |                                                                                |

Management

- Lesions that meet Milan criteria can qualify for MELD exception
    points and are considered transplant candidates

<!-- -->

- This accounts for pts with minimal synthetic dysfunction (and
    therefore low MELD)

<!-- -->

- Milan criteria:

<!-- -->

- Single tumor with diameter \>2cm but \<5 cm, no more than 3 tumors,
    each \<3 cm

- No signs of extra-hepatic involvement or vascular invasion

<!-- -->

- Liver transplant is definitive treatment, although resection can
    also be curative (favored in pts with early cirrhosis i.e. Child
    Pugh A)

- Locoregional therapies: Pts with unresectable disease, or who are
    not surgical candidates

| Therapy                                    | Details                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Radiofrequency ablation                    | If in a favorable location and size, IR can percutaneously ablate with a large needle that emits microwave frequencies |
| Trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE)    | Chemotherapeutic agents injected into the tumor to occlude the feeding blood supply to the area.                       |
| Trans-arterial radioembolization (TARE)    | Like TACE, though radioactive compound (i.e. Y-90) used to occlude the feeding blood supply.                           |
| Stereotactic body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) | Radiation therapy: can be used as an alternative to ablation or trans-arterial therapy                                 |
| Systemic Chemotherapy                      | For metastatic disease                                                                                                 |

Coagulopathy in Cirrhosis – Garren Montgomery, John Laurenzano

Background

- The liver is responsible for production of both pro- (factor II, V,
    VII, IV, X, and XI) and anti-coagulants (protein C, S) in
    hemostasis. Factor VIII is the only one not made by the liver.

- Thrombocytopenia is caused by splenic sequestration from portal HTN,
    failure to produce thrombopoietin (TPO), and bone marrow failure

Evaluation

- INR/PT, and PTT are poorly reflective of bleeding risk

- TEG screens and other measures of comprehensive coagulation in
    cirrhotics

Management

- Even in bleeding, there is no need to intervene on an INR or
    platelet value

- Pre-procedural FFP is not recommended, even in the presence of
    bleeding, but is frequently requested by different proceduralists

- Low risk procedures (i.e., paracentesis) do not require
    pre-procedural blood products

- In bleeding pts, the following are recommended per AASLD and AGA
    guidelines

<!-- -->

- IV Vitamin K 10mg x 3 days

- FFP: Not recommended, unless as part of a balanced transfusion
    effort to avoid transfusion related coagulopathy, or if a TEG screen
    suggests potential benefit

- Cryoprecipitate: if fibrinogen \< 120

- Platelets: No specific targets regardless of bleeding.
    Pre-procedurally, recommend \>50

<!-- -->

- Appropriate DVT ppx should be given with few exceptions (plts \<50k,
    active hemorrhage)

- For TEG transfusion recommendations are as follows:

<!-- -->

- 10 mg/kg FFP if R-time \>10 minutes

- 1u Plts if maximum amplitude \<55 mm

- 5u cryo if alpha angle \<45

Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT) – John Laurenzano

Background

- Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT) can worsen decompensation (i.e.
    variceal hemorrhage), however, worsening portal HTN more sluggish
    flow increased risk PVT

Presentation

- Often identified asymptomatically on U/S, but can be identified by
    new or worsening decompensation of portal HTN

- Variceal hemorrhage is the most common decompensating event
    associated with PVT

- Intestinal ischemia (abdominal pain, hematochezia) from PVT is
    exceedingly rare but associated with significant morbidity and
    mortality

Evaluation

- RUQ U/S with doppler

<!-- -->

- Once identified, should be further assessed with triple phase CT or
    MRI with Gadovist contrast to exclude HCC with tumor thrombus

<!-- -->

- Pts with newly identified PVT should undergo EGD to evaluate for
    high-risk varices, both for diagnostic and therapeutic
    considerations

- PVT in pts without cirrhosis should prompt evaluation for
    hypercoagulable disorders

Management

- Start anticoagulation if acute thrombus occludes \>50% of main
    portal vein, \<50% but extends into SMV, thrombus is symptomatic, or
    patient is a transplant candidate (irrespective of size). Requires
    discussion with attending/transplant team.

<!-- -->

- Anticoagulation options: warfarin, LMWH, or DOAC

- DOAC’s are safe in Childs Class A, can be used with caution in
    Childs B, and are contraindicated in Childs C

<!-- -->

- Pts with chronic occlusive PVT (\>6 mos) or with cavernous
    transformation with collaterals do not generally benefit from
    anticoagulation

- Pts with high-risk varices should undergo endoscopic management or
    be on NSBB for prophylaxis for variceal hemorrhage, as noted above

- TIPS with portal vein recanalization has recently emerged as a
    therapeutic modality for PVT

- Pts should undergo follow up intermittently with ultrasound to
    assess for recanalization. AC may be stopped if there is failure to
    recanalize.

- If pts are not candidates for AC, they'll simply be treated for
    complications of portal HTN

Alcoholic Hepatitis – Alex Wiles, Julie Cui

Background

- Acute onset of rapidly progressive jaundice in pt with heavy EtOH
    intake (\>40g in females or \>60g in males EtOH/day for \>6 mos, or
    within \<60 days of abstinence)

<!-- -->

- May present after they have quit drinking due to immunosuppressive
    effects of alcohol

Evaluation

- AST \>60, AST/ALT \>1.5, both values \<400 IU/L; TBili \>3.0 mg/dL,
    documentation of heavy EtOH use until 8 weeks prior to presentation

- Prognostication with Maddrey’s Discriminant Function: 4.6 \* (PTpt –
    PTctrl) + Tbili

<!-- -->

- Maddrey \> 32 = poor 30d prognosis & may benefit from steroids (see
    below)

<!-- -->

- RUQ U/S to rule out obstructive cause of jaundice

- Biopsy is not typically required but will show neutrophilic lobular
    inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, steatosis, and pericellular
    fibrosis.

- Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) level is a biomarker of ethanol
    consumption over \~ 4wks; \>20 ng/mL can indicate chronic
    moderate/heavy alcohol intake

<!-- -->

- A single episode consumption can result in detectable Peth for up to
    12 days. Can be elevated for months with regular heavy alcohol
    intake

- EtOH levels may be negative unless acutely intoxicated

Management

- Supportive Care is essential! Consult nutrition, start high protein,
    high calorie diet, high dose Thiamine x 3d, Folate, MVI

- Full infection workup (CXR, UA, BCx, paracentesis) regardless of
    symptoms

- Steroids: STOP-AH Trial (NEJM 2015) showed improved mortality at 28
    days but not at 90 days in patients with Maddrey \> 32 who received
    steroids; the decision to treat is very nuanced and should be
    discussed with hepatology attending.

<!-- -->

- Prednisolone 40mg daily for pts who meet above criteria

    - Contraindications to steroids include: presence of infection
        (must rule out first including TB, uncontrolled GI bleeding, AKI
        w/ Cr \>2.5 mg/dL)

- The Lille score can be used to guide continuation of steroids after
    7 d of therapy

- NAC can be considered as adjunctive therapy to steroids and may
    decrease 30-day mortality, though has not demonstrated longer
    mortality benefit at 3 or 6 months

<!-- -->

- Monitor on CIWA

<!-- -->

- Psychiatry consultation as appropriate, consideration of medical
    therapy (see “Substance Use Disorders” section in psychiatry)

NASH and NAFLD – John Laurenzano

Background

- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): presence of hepatic
    steatosis in the absence of secondary causes (e.g, EtOH)

- Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): evidence of active
    inflammation in conjunction with steatosis (elevated liver enzymes
    or evidence on bx)

- Strong association with metabolic syndrome, T2DM, HTN, obesity,
    prior cholecystectomy

- Generally asymptomatic

- Considered to be a common cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis

Evaluation

- NASH manifests with elevated liver enzymes, typically 2-5x the ULN,
    in a roughly 1:1 ratio (as opposed to alcoholic steatohepatitis),
    though ALT may be higher than AST

- NAFLD is asymptomatic and frequently found incidentally via imaging

- Exclusion of alternative causes and comorbid liver conditions: HCV,
    HBV, EtOH

- Note: Ferritin is frequently elevated, though not to the extent of
    hemochromatosis. Low level auto-antibodies are also frequently
    present

- Can be diagnosed based on imaging alone (and frequently is)

<!-- -->

- Ultrasound is used most frequently, though MRI and CT also are
    acceptable; use risk scores to determine the risk of advanced
    fibrosis and identify those who would benefit from biopsy

    - Fibrosis-4 (FIB 4) score

    - NAFLD fibrosis score

- More accurate, non-invasive fibrosis assessments can be done using
    elastography which can be vibration based (fibroscan), ultrasound
    based (sheer-wave), or MR-based

    - Available at VUMC and can be ordered by anyone. Insurance will
        not cover MRE if BMI \<35

Management

- Aggressive risk factor modification and management of comorbidities
    (HLD, HTN, T2DM)

- Weight loss: Mediterranean diet\>low fat diet (dose dependent
    improvement)

- No specific medications are FDA approved currently

<!-- -->

- Pioglitazone has shown benefit in pts with T2DM and NASH

- Vitamin E has shown benefit in pts without T2DM and proven NASH

- Ongoing studies for SGLT-2i and GLP-1ra; some promise indicated for
    the latter

<!-- -->

- While bariatric surgery is not a specific indication for NASH/NAFLD,
    increasing evidence demonstrates resolution of NASH and fibrosis in
    pts with clinically significant weight loss

- Referral to the surgical weight loss clinic should be considered in
    any patient who meets obesity guidelines for bariatric surgery (BMI
    \>40, or \>35 with metabolic comorbidities)

Additional Information

- Statins: should be used for HLD in pts with NASH, NAFLD and NASH
    cirrhosis

- Statin use in decompensated NASH cirrhosis is controversial, and
    they are less likely to derive benefit given overall poor prognosis.
    There is an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis in pts with acute on
    chronic liver failure and are considered contraindicated

- Metformin is safe and may have a survival benefit in patients with
    diabetes and cirrhosis. Discontinue only in those who have increased
    risk for lactic acidosis (renal impairment and significant EtOH).
    Sulfonylureas are generally avoided.

Acute Liver Injury and Failure – Jacob Parnell, Judd Heideman, Hannah
Lomzenski, and Lauren Chan

Background

- Acute liver injury (ALI): elevated liver enzymes + INR ≥1.5 but NO
    encephalopathy

- Acute liver failure (ALF): elevated liver enzymes +
    encephalopathy/AMS in the absence of pre-existing liver disease\*

<!-- -->

- \*Chronic autoimmune hepatitis, HBV, Wilson disease, and Budd-Chiari
    syndrome can have ALF if they develop new AMS, despite the presence
    of a pre-existing liver disease

<!-- -->

- Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is not ALF (see above)

Etiology

- R-factor (if history, exam, and diagnostic data are inconclusive
    i.e. R-factor is not a replacement to clinical judgement) = (ALT/uln
    ALT) / (ALP/uln ALP); See chart below

<!-- -->

- R \> 5 = hepatocellular injury; R\<2 = cholestatic injury; R 2-5 =
    mixed injury

Evaluation

- Consult hepatology early! (to assist with workup AND for transplant
    evaluation)

- Labs:

- CBC w/diff, CMP, Dbili, Mg, Phos, T&S, BCx, UCx, PT/INR, aPTT,
    fibrinogen

- Amylase, lipase

- Beta-hCG for females of childbearing age

- ABG with arterial lactate, ammonia (arterial \>124 predicts
    mortality and CNS complications e.g., need for intubation, seizures,
    cerebral edema, \<75 very unlikely to develop ICH)

- Viral etiologies: Viral hepatitis serologies (HAV panel, HBV panel,
    HCV IgG +/- PCR quant, HDV if known HBV (with low or undetectable
    HBV load) as Misc Reference Test, Hepatitis E PCR sent as
    miscellaneous if pregnant or travel to southeast Asia), HIV p24 Ag
    and HIV Ab, EBV Qt, CMV Qt, HSV 1/2, Qt, VZV IgM/IgG

- Toxins: UDS, ethanol level +/- Peth, acetaminophen level (drawn ≥4
    hours after last known ingestion), salicylate level

- Autoimmune/genetic: ANA, ASMA, IgG, AMA (if predominantly elevated
    ALP), ceruloplasmin

<!-- -->

- Imaging:

<!-- -->

- RUQ U/S with doppler

- Consider CT with contrast in patients with normal renal function and
    high suspicion of Budd-Chiari syndrome or malignancy with negative
    ultrasound (better for assessing the hepatic veins) and helps with
    transplant evaluation

- Consider ERCP/MRCP for cholestatic etiologies

Criteria for Transplantation:

- King’s College criteria: helps identify patients needing transplant
    referral/consideration for acetaminophen overdose

<!-- -->

- Arterial pH \<7.3 after resuscitation and \>24 hr since ingestion,
    OR

- Arterial lactate \>3 after adequate fluid resuscitation, OR

- Grade III- IV HE, SCr \>3.4, and INR \>6.5 all within 24h period

<!-- -->

- ALF not due to acetaminophen: INR \> 6.5 OR 3 of the 5 following
    criteria:

<!-- -->

- Indeterminate non HAV, non HBV etiology, drug-induced hepatitis

- Age \<10 or \>40

- Interval of jaundice to onset of encephalopathy \>7 days

- Bilirubin \> 17.5mg/dl (300μmol/L)

- INR \>3.5

Management

- Any pt with concern for ALF should be cared for in MICU (even if
    mild change in mental status)

- Pts with ALF may die acutely from hypoglycemia, cerebral edema, and
    infection

- ABC’s:

<!-- -->

- Intubate for GCS \<8, Grade 3 or 4 HE

- IVF resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid (most pts are volume
    deplete; avoid hypotonic fluids due to risk of cerebral edema)

- Vasopressive agents for persistent hypotension (guidelines outline
    the choice of pressors and should be here)

<!-- -->

- Monitoring:

<!-- -->

- Q1-2h neuro checks, Q1-2h glucose checks

- Closely monitor CMP, INR q6-8 hrs

<!-- -->

- Treatment of Primary Injury

<!-- -->

- IV N-acetylcysteine: Must be given when acetaminophen toxicity is
    known or suspected. It may be considered in other etiologies of ALF
    as it may improve transplant-free survival especially those with ALF
    due to non acetaminophen DILI.

    - Initial loading dose = 150mg/kg over 1 hour, then 50mg/kg/hr for
        4 hours, then 100mg/kg/hr for 16 hours

    - Patients with early-stage hepatic encephalopathy (grade I/II)
        have increased transplant free survival, while those with grade
        III/IV do not

<!-- -->

- Treatment of Secondary Complications

<!-- -->

- Infection: Rule out infection with CXR, Blood cultures, UA for every
    ALF. Antibiotics only if progressing HE, signs of infection, or
    development of SIRS

- Cerebral edema/increased ICP:

    - Grade I-II hepatic encephalopathy: lactulose but should not be
        administered to the point of diarrhea, and may interfere with
        the surgical field by increasing bowel distention during liver
        transplantation

    - Grade III-IV hepatic encephalopathy: elevated HOB to 30 degrees,
        quiet and dimly lit room, should be intubated, and ICP monitor
        are recommended (if not feasible, hourly neuro checks can be an
        alternative). If ICP becomes elevated:

        - Mannitol (0.5-1g/kg) is first line

        - If high ICP is refractory to osmotic agents, consider
            phenobarbital, indomethacin, and/or cooling to 33-34 degrees
            Celsius if awaiting LT

        - Hyperventilation may be considered for impending ventilation

- Seizures: phenytoin (no evidence to support seizure ppx), short
    acting benzodiazepines if refractory

- Renal Failure: early CRRT if persistent metabolic acidosis, volume
    overload, falling UOP

- Coagulopathy: IV Vit K (at least one dose) routinely to rule out Vit
    K deficiency, products for invasive procedures or active bleeding
    only

- Metabolic: Correction of hypoglycemia and electrolyte abnormalities

- Circulatory dysfunction/shock: Goal MAP \>75 mmHg. Ensure
    intravascularly replete, add norepinephrine first line, vasopressin
    can be used second line but may increase ICP. Consider stress dose
    steroids for refractory shock.

<!-- -->

- Additional Supportive Care

<!-- -->

- PPI for bleeding ppx

- Enteral nutrition EARLY; avoid TPN if possible

- Prefer propofol for sedation for better neuro exams and may reduce
    cerebral blood flow

Specific Management by Etiology:

- Acetaminophen

<!-- -->

- Early toxicology consultation if suspected ingestion/overdose

- For acute management contact Poison Control 800-222-1222

- Activated charcoal within 4 hours of ingestion, most effective
    within 1 hour

- IV N-acetylcysteine per protocol, look up Rumack-Matthew Nomogram
    and consult with toxicology

    - In Epic: search “N-acetylcysteine” and select order set
        “Acetaminophen overdose”

<!-- -->

- AFLP/HELLP – delivery

- Amanita phalloides – IV fluid resuscitation, PO charcoal, IV
    penicillin, IV acetylcysteine

- Autoimmune – IV steroids following approval by hepatology (and
    typically post biopsy). Azathioprine generally deferred until
    cholestasis resolved (Mycophenolate can be used instead)

- Budd-Chiari – anticoagulation, IR-guided endovascular therapy,
    transplant (must rule out underlying malignancy and evaluate for
    thrombotic disorders)

- HAV/HEV – supportive care, consider ribavirin for ALF due to HEV

- HBV – nucleos(t)ide analogue; orthotopic liver transplant

- HSV – acyclovir
