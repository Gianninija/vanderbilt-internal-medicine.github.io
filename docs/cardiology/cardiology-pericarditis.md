# Pericarditis

## Background
- Inflammation of the pericardial sac
- Etiologies:
  -   Infectious: Viral (Coxsackievirus, adenovirus, COVID-19), bacterial
      (TB, staph, strep), fungal
  -   Inflammatory: Rheumatologic (most commonly SLE and RA),
      post-radiation, vaccine reaction, post pericardiotomy syndrome
  -   Cardiac: Infarction (Dressler syndrome) and myocarditis
  -   Miscellaneous: Trauma (including procedures e.g. cath, cardiac
      surgery), metabolic (uremia, hypothyroid), drug-induced, malignancy
  -   Idiopathic (most common cause, assumed to be viral/post-viral)

## Presentation
- At least two criteria of four should be present:
  -   Sharp substernal pleuritic chest pain that is better with leaning
    forward
  -   Pericardial friction rub
  -   New widespread ST elevation and PR depression
  -   New or worsening pericardial effusion
-   Chest pain almost always present. Pericardial rub highly specific
-   Even small effusion can help confirm diagnosis, but lack thereof
    does not rule it out

## Evaluation and Management
- Always: EKG, chest x-ray, BMP, CBC, troponin, ESR, CRP and TTE
  - TTE should be performed ASAP if tamponade suspected
- In select populations if warranted: Blood cultures, ANA, RF,
    anti-CCP, PPD, chest CT
- Treatment:
  - NSAIDs (or glucocorticoids if contraindications to NSAIDs) AND
    colchicine
    -   Ibuprofen 600-800mg TID (duration based on symptom resolution and
    normalization of CRP)
    -   Prednisone 0.2-0.5mg/kg daily for 2 weeks followed by tape
    -   Colchicine 0.6mg orally BID for 3 months
