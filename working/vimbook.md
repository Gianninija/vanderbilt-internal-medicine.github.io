Inpatient Diabetes Mellitus (DM) – Will Bassett

Background

- Blood glucose (BG) goal

<!-- -->

- Wards: \<140 mg/dL fasting; \<180 mg/dL random; increase for
    elderly, “sicker” patients

- ICU: 140-180 mg/dL (NICE-SUGAR Trial)

- Avoiding hypoglycemia in critically ill patients is more important
    than targeting ideal BG

Management

- Initial orders

<!-- -->

- HOLD all home oral diabetes medications (except empagliflozin in
    heart failure pts)

- Always dose reduce home insulin (typically 50-60% of home dose for
    type 2; 80% for type 1) for changes in diet. If AKI present,
    consider reducing by more.

    - Patients with Type 1 DM always need basal insulin, even if NPO
        or else will lead to DKA

- Order set “SUBCUTANEOUS INSULIN ORDER(S)”

    - Hemoglobin A1c. Can consider if none in last 3 months and
        concern for poor outpatient control. A1c does not routinely
        affect inpatient management

    - Fingerstick blood glucose: Typically AC/HS (before meals and
        nightly)

    - Hypoglycemia management: Select all of these

    - Basal insulin:

        - Type 2 DM, consider ↓ home dose (50-60% to home dose) as
            often inpatients have reduced PO intake and ↓ renal function

        - Type 1 DM, DO NOT hold basal insulin, and avoid ↓ \< 80% of
            home dose

        - Unnecessary if no home basal insulin

    - Insulin lispro meal: ↓ home dose by 1/2, do not give while NPO

    - Lispro insulin correction scale: Start with Low or Medium
        sliding scale and ↑ prn

- Carb-controlled or carb-restricted diet

<!-- -->

- Insulin adjustments

<!-- -->

- If BGs persistently \>200

    - Calculate all insulin needs over 24h (basal + mealtime + sliding
        scale)

        - Give 50% as basal and other 50% as 3 divided mealtime doses

        - E.g. 10 basal + 0 mealtime + 14 sliding scale total = 24
            units total daily = 12u basal + 4u TID with meals

        - If new to basal, safe start is 0.2 u/kg daily if normal GFR

- If BGs \< 70

    - If overnight/AM, reduce basal insulin dose

    - If daytime/post-prandial hypoglycemia, reduce mealtime and
        sliding scale

    - Less is more! Blood glucose in the low 200s is better than the
        50s

    - If endocrine consulted for inpatient glucose management, please
        notify \>24h prior to discharge if you want recommended
        discharge regimen

Steroid-induced Hyperglycemia

- Steroids increase insulin resistance causing elevated postprandial
    BG

- Insulin adjustments

<!-- -->

- Double mealtime + correction dose with leaving the basal the same

- Modified basal bolus regimen (30% basal, 70% bolus)

- Add NPH once daily (weight + dose based, per below\*) if on daily
    prednisone

    - Prednisone 10 mg = 0.1 u/kg NPH

    - Prednisone 20 mg = 0.2 u/kg NPH up to 0.4 u/kg daily

    - \*lower dose if AKI, administer at the same time as prednisone
        dosing

<!-- -->

- On discharge, if steroids will be longstanding, increase home
    insulin regimen per inpatient requirements. If steroids will be
    tapered or discontinued soon after, either continue hospital regimen
    for remainder of steroid course or return to home regimen
    (hyperglycemia is better than hypoglycemia)

Additional Information

- At the VA, NPH is formulary

<!-- -->

- If a pt takes Lantus at home, this can be continued; otherwise, a
    PADR is needed.

- NPH’s duration of action is shorter than Lantus and, in most cases,
    should be dosed q12h. The conversion is done by taking total Lantus
    dose and dividing it two doses.

<!-- -->

- Tube feeds

<!-- -->

- Dose regular insulin q6h (not TID AC as they don’t have distinct
    “meals”)

- Consolidate for bolus feedings based on 24-hour insulin needs prior
    to discharge

<!-- -->

- Insulin pumps

<!-- -->

- If a patient has a pump and supplies, reasonably controlled BG, is
    willing and able to manage pump then s/he can keep the pump on.
    <u>This requires a Diabetes Consult.</u>

- Still order POC BG checks AC/HS for nurse to chart and fill out
    MedEx pump contract

Hypoglycemia – Will Bassett

Background

- Definition: BG \<70 mg/dL

<!-- -->

- Generally worse outcomes than hyperglycemia

<!-- -->

- Causes: infection, liver failure, iatrogenic (e.g. insulin not
    adjusted for AKI or being NPO)

- Symptoms vary from tremor, palpitations, delirium, dizziness, AMS,
    coma

Management

- Give PO carbohydrate load (15-20g oral glucose) if pt is alert and
    tolerates PO

- Give IV D50 if severe (\<50), or cannot take PO

- Repeat measurements after 15 minutes and treat again as needed

- Give glucagon 0.5-1mg SQ/IM if no IV access and impaired
    consciousness

<!-- -->

- Effect is transient and IV access should be obtained ASAP for
    glucose infusion

<!-- -->

- Do NOT hold basal insulin for T1DM: treat the low, then reduce dose
    if needed

Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) – Will Bassett, Matthew Gonzalez

Background

- Classically in type 1 diabetes but can also occur in
    insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes

- Definition: ↑ blood glucose (typically \>350) w/ high anion gap and
    ketones in blood/urine

- If glucose is significantly elevated but little to no ketones/anion
    gap present, you likely have HHS, which is typically associated with
    ↑ serum osm and BG \> 600

Evaluation

- Labs: BMP with anion gap (AG), CBC, phos, blood gas, serum osms, UA,
    consider beta-hydroxybutyrate

- Workup aimed at discovering the underlying cause (The "I’s"):

<!-- -->

- Infection/ Inflammation: CBC, CXR, UA/UCx, LFTs; consider BCx,
    lipase (pancreatitis). Note: Leukocytosis will be present in DKA,
    even if infection isn’t the precipitating factor

- Ischemia (MI, CVA, mesenteric ischemia): EKG, Troponin, CT(A) if
    clinical suspicion

- Intoxication - Ethanol (can cause ketosis with or without acidosis),
    cocaine, MDMA

- Impregnation - Beta HCG if appropriate

- Insulin-openia/Iatrogenic: steroids, SGLT2 inhibitors, other meds,
    insulin delivery failure (pump failure, insulin degraded by heat,
    etc.)

<!-- -->

- Remember to correct sodium for hyperglycemia (Na + 2.4 mEq \*
    (BG-100))

Management

- Initial monitoring: q2-4h BMPs (monitor K closely), q1h BG
    fingersticks

<!-- -->

- Can space less frequently once gap is closed x 2 and patient off
    insulin infusion

<!-- -->

- Ensure IV access

- Start IV fluids, insulin, and potassium as below

<!-- -->

- Start insulin gtt

- Start subcutaneous long-acting insulin as soon as insulin drip/IV
    insulin is started

    - Either start home long-acting (dose reduce as needed) or if
        insulin naïve, lantus 0.2-0.3u/kg/day

- Lactated ringers’ preferred fluid if no contraindication

- Dextrose should be added when BG \<200 (or clear liquid diet)

- Turn off insulin drip when anion gap is closed on two consecutive
    BMPs

<!-- -->

- Consult endocrinology early

- Management algorithm on next page (Diabetes Care. 2009 Jul; 32(7):
    1335–1343)

- Note: pts are usually deficient in total body potassium even if
    their serum potassium is high

Additional Information

- Pts on insulin drip can be admitted to stepdown (8MCE) with order
    set

- Pts can be admitted to stepdown on a subcutaneous insulin protocol
    with mild DKA with endocrinology guiding insulin management

- Avoid ordering C-peptide if concern for new type 1 diabetes, beta
    islet cells can be "stunned" with recent hyperglycemic states and
    may be falsely low

- SGLT2 inhibitors, are being prescribed much more often and can cause
    a euglycemic DKA, where acidosis and ketosis present but no elevated
    BG

Hypothyroidism – Griffin Bullock

Background

- Elevated TSH and low FT4 (primary hypothyroidism)

<!-- -->

- Hashimoto’s (autoimmune) thyroiditis, iodine deficiency, drugs
    (amiodarone, dopamine antagonists), adrenal insufficiency, thyroid
    hormone resistance (genetic), non-thyroidal illness (recovery
    phase), post-surgery or ablation for hyperthyroidism

<!-- -->

- Elevated TSH and normal FT4: subclinical hypothyroidism

- Low-Normal TSH, low FT4: central hypothyroidism, sick euthyroid

Presentation

- Often non-specific and vague: fatigue, cold intolerance, weight
    gain, constipation, dry skin, myalgia, edema menstrual
    irregularities, depression, mental dysfunction

- Goiter, bradycardia, diastolic hypertension, delayed relaxation
    following reflex testing

- Lab abnormalities: microcytic anemia, hypercholesterolemia,
    hyponatremia, elevated CK

Evaluation

- TSH: If elevated repeat TSH and obtain T4

- Lipid panel, CBC, BMP

Management

- Treatment required if ↓ T4, significantly ↑ TSH (\>10), or symptoms
    with any lab abnormality

- Titrate therapy to a normal TSH (unless central hypothyroidism, then
    target free T4 levels)

- Observation of asymptomatic pts with subclinical hypothyroidism
    (normal T4, mild ↑ TSH)

- Treatment is with formulation of T4 (full replacement is
    approximately 1.6 mcg/kg/day)

- Initial Dose:

<!-- -->

- Young/healthy patients: full anticipated dose

- Older patients or patients with CAD: 25-50 mcg daily

<!-- -->

- Increased doses required for: pregnancy, estrogen therapy, weight
    gain, PPI therapy, GI disorders (↓ absorption), ferrous sulfate
    therapy

Additional information

- Pts should take Levothyroxine alone, 1 hr prior to eating to ensure
    appropriate absorption

- Of note, missed doses can be taken along with the next dose

- Symptoms improve in 2-3 weeks. TSH steady state requires 6 weeks

- Dose can be titrated every 6 weeks based on TSH

- Pregnancy: Pregnancy causes lab changes due to differing levels
    thyroid binding globulin. Use tables based on trimester to interpret
    values

<!-- -->

- TPO antibody testing should be conducted if abnormal as this affects
    risk of complications

- Hypothyroid pts are at increased risk for preeclampsia, placental
    abruption, preterm labor/delivery

- Refer to endocrine for close monitoring and adjustment to avoid
    fetal complications

Thyroid Nodules – Terra Swanson

Background

- \~50% of adults will have a thyroid nodule on ultrasound

- Benign: goiter, cyst, inflammatory, Hashimoto’s, follicular adenoma
    (microadenoma)

- Malignant: follicular, papillary, medullary, anaplastic, metastatic,
    thyroid lymphoma

- Risk factors for malignancy: age \<30, head or neck radiation,
    family history of thyroid cancer

Evaluation

- Initial work-up after a nodule is found (either clinically or
    incidentally on imaging)

<!-- -->

- TSH, Free T4, Thyroid U/S

Management

- If Low TSH: Likely a hyperfunctioning nodule (benign in 95% of
    cases)

<!-- -->

- Order Iodine-123 or technetium-99m thyroid scan

    - If hyperfunctioning → measure T3/free T4 if ↑, treat for
        hyperthyroidism

    - If non-functioning → proceed as if TSH were normal

<!-- -->

- Normal or elevated TSH:

<!-- -->

- FNA indicated based on U/S findings listed below (determined by
    TI-RADS system)

    - Nodules \>1 cm that have high- or intermediate-suspicion pattern

    - Nodules \>1.5 cm that have low-suspicion pattern

    - Nodules \>2 cm that have very-low-suspicion pattern

- FNA cytology determines the plan of action:

    - Benign → periodic US monitoring at 12-24 months, then at
        increasing intervals

    - Indeterminate → repeat FNA in 3-12 months

    - Malignant → surgical referral

<!-- -->

- Nodules that do not meet FNA criteria, US findings determine the
    timing for follow-up imaging:

<!-- -->

- High suspicion: 6-12 months

- Low to intermediate suspicion: 12-24 months

- Nodules \>1 cm with very ↓ suspicion OR pure cyst: \>24 months if at
    all

<!-- -->

- Nodules \<1 cm with very ↓ suspicion OR pure cyst: no further
    imaging necessary

Hyperthyroidism – Griffin Bullock

Background

- Low TSH and High T4 and/or T3 (primary): Graves’ disease, Toxic
    goiter, TSH-producing adenoma, hyperemesis gravidarum, subacute
    granulomatous thyroiditis, amiodarone, radiation, excessive
    replacement, struma ovarii

- Low TSH/Normal T4 and T3: Subclinical hyperthyroidism, central
    hypothyroidism, non-thyroidal illness, recovery from
    hyperthyroidism, pregnancy (physiologic)

- Subclinical Hyperthyroidism: repeat testing to verify abnormality is
    not transient

Presentation

- Anxiety, emotional lability, heat intolerance, tremor, palpitations,
    increased appetite, unexplained weight loss, new onset atrial
    fibrillation, myopathy, menstrual disorder, exophthalmos,
    tachycardia, pretibial myxedema, hyperreflexia, lid lag, changes to
    hair or skin

Evaluation

- TSH, free T4, free T3 (only T3 or T4 may be elevated, though both
    often are)

<!-- -->

- Biotin affects assay, causes falsely ↓ TSH and falsely ↑ FT4/FT3

<!-- -->

- CBC: May have a normocytic anemia due to increased plasma volume

Management

- Thyrotropin antibodies (Graves-specific test, not sensitive)

- Radioiodine uptake scan if thyrotropin antibodies negative

- Treatment: methimazole, PTU, beta blockers, radioiodine ablation,
    surgery

- Pts should be referred to endocrinology for treatment plan based on
    work up

Thyroid Storm – Gaby Schroeder

Background

- Diagnosis is based on recognition of exaggerated signs/symptoms of
    thyrotoxicosis leading to multi-organ dysfunction in the setting of
    precipitating event

- Common Precipitants: Grave’s Disease, surgery, trauma, pregnancy,
    stress, infection, MI/PE, medication non-compliance, iodine loads

- Use Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS); available on MD Calc

<!-- -->

- \>45 highly suggestive

- 25-44 impending storm

- \<25 unlikely to represent storm

Management

- ENDOCRINE EMERGENCY - if suspected consult Endocrine ASAP

- Therapies directed towards thyroid gland

<!-- -->

- PTU: Preferred, 500-1000mg loading dose, followed by 250mg q4 -6
    hours (PO, rectal)

- Methimazole: q4-6 hours, dose varies (PO, rectal, IV)

<!-- -->

- Therapies directed toward decreasing T4 to T3 conversion

<!-- -->

- Propranolol (60-80mg PO q4)

- Hydrocortisone (300mg x1, 100mg q8) - treats high incidence of
    co-existing adrenal insufficiency

<!-- -->

- Cholestyramine 4g QID can be considered to reduce enteric
    recirculation

- Refractory Storm: plasmapheresis and plasma exchange

- Close hemodynamic monitoring, may need vasopressors (consider
    transfer to ICU)

Adrenal Insufficiency – Griffin Bullock

Background

- Differential: Primary (Adrenals) vs Secondary (Pituitary):

<!-- -->

- Exogenous steroid use (\>10 mg for \>3wks) undergoing severe
    physiologic stress or sudden discontinuation of steroid

- Autoimmune adrenal insufficiency

- Infection/Infiltration: tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, malignancy

- Hemorrhage (Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome)

- Pituitary mass/tumor, infarct, infiltration, surgery

- Trauma

Presentation

- Generalized weakness, lightheaded, abdominal pain, nausea, weight
    loss, fatigue

- Lab Abnormalities: hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hypoglycemia

Evaluation

- Inpatient Setting

<!-- -->

- Draw AM cortisol and ACTH (ideally 8am) 0.25mg cosyntropin cortisol
    1 hour after

    - Cortisol level ≥18-20 rules out primary adrenal insufficiency
        (and most secondary)

<!-- -->

- Outpatient Setting

<!-- -->

- Draw AM cortisol level for screening (\>15 rules typically rules out
    adrenal insufficiency)

- ACTH stimulation for confirmation

Management

- Consult endocrine if ACTH stimulation test is abnormal

- Adrenal crisis (if concerned, treat first, test later)

<!-- -->

- BMP, glucose monitoring, ACTH level, serum cortisol

- Fluid resuscitation: NS or D5NS. Do not use hypotonic saline.

- Hydrocortisone 100mg x1 followed by 50mg q8h

Stress Dose Steroids – Griffin Bullock

Primary Options

- Dexamethasone 4 mg IV: does not affect cortisol assays, ideal if
    diagnosis uncertain

- Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV bolus then 50 mg q8h until stable: greater
    mineralocorticoid activity. Ideal if adrenal insufficiency
    known/confirmed or if hyperkalemic (K\>6.0)

When to Use

- Concern for adrenal crisis

- Patients with known adrenal insufficiency:

<!-- -->

- Minor Illness: ↑ dose x3 for 3 d or until clinically improved &
    acute stress resolved

<!-- -->

- Surgery: dependent on severity of operation

<!-- -->

- Minor (e.g. hernia repair): hydrocortisone 25 mg for 1 day

- Moderate (e.g. cholecystectomy): 50-75 mg day of surgery and post-op
    day 1

- Major (e.g. CABG): 100-150 mg daily 2-3 days (would consult
    endocrine in this setting)

- Trauma, critical illness, or unclear give stress dose

Severe Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) – Chloe de Crecy

Background

- Elevated triglycerides (TG) on a <u>fasting</u> lipid panel

<!-- -->

- Normal: \<150 mg/dL

- Moderate HTG: 150-499 mg/dL

- Moderate to severe HTG: 500-999 mg/dL

- Severe HTG: \>1000 mg/dL

<!-- -->

- Nearly all patients with severe HTG have a genetic predisposition
    and an additional factor known to raise serum TGs (e.g. diabetes,
    alcohol abuse, oral estrogen therapy, hypothyroidism, nephrotic
    syndrome, propofol, ART)

- Risks of hypertriglyceridemia: pancreatitis (requires serum TG \>500
    mg/dL), ASCVD

- Signs: xanthomas, hepatosplenomegaly, lipemia retinalis, milky
    appearance of plasma

- Symptoms: short-term memory loss, abdominal pain, flushing with
    alcohol

Evaluation

- Order lipid panel for: usual outpatient screening, acute
    pancreatitis, cutaneous xanthomas, family members with familial HTG,
    monitoring HTG treatment

- Note: Sodium, glucose, amylase, LDL readings can be affected by HTG

- Consider sending A1c, Cr, TSH

- Assess medication list for secondary causes

Management

- HTG induced pancreatitis

<!-- -->

- If pt has hypocalcemia, lactic acidosis, or multi-organ dysfunction

    - Initiate plasmapheresis and monitor serum TG after each cycle
        until \<500

    - Severe dietary fat restriction (\<5%) until TG \<1000

- If none of the above and pt is hyperglycemic

    - Start insulin gtt, IVF, monitor q1h BG and q12h TG

    - Discontinue insulin when serum TG \<500

    - Severe dietary fat restriction (\<5%) until TG \<1000

- If none of the above and patient is euglycemic

    - Monitor q12h TG until \<500

    - Severe dietary fat restriction (\<5%) until TG \<1000

<!-- -->

- Long-term Management (once TG \<1000, otherwise decreased efficacy)

<!-- -->

- Pharmacologic: fibrates (most commonly fenofibrate), statins,
    niacin, omega-3 fatty acids

- Nonpharmacologic: discontinue alcohol use, dietary fat and sugar
    restriction (target fat intake at \<10% of calorie intake), exercise

Adrenal Incidentalomas – Matthew Gonzalez

Background

- Adrenal mass \>1cm, discovered by chance on radiographic imaging

- Less than 1% are malignant

- Supportive of benign: \<4 cm in size, smooth borders, homogenous
    appearance, \<10 HU (Hounsfield units), rapid contrast washout (on
    "adrenal phase" imaging)

- Supportive of malignancy: \>4 cm in size, irregular borders, \> 20
    HU on unenhanced CT, delayed contrast washout, tumor calcifications,
    increase in size over time, presence in young pts and hx cancer

    Evaluation

- All incidentalomas should be screened for pheochromocytoma (\~3%
    incidence) before operative intervention (24-hour urine fractionated
    metanephrines, catecholamines, plasma fractionated metanephrines)

- Cortisol secreting adenoma (\~6% incidence) causing Cushing's
    syndrome: baseline serum DHEAS, low dose (1mg) overnight
    dexamethasone suppression test

- Aldosterone secreting adenoma (\<1% incidence) causing
    hyperaldosteronism: if hypertensive (HTN) or hypokalemic order
    plasma aldosterone and renin, confirmatory testing with sodium
    loading (oral vs IV) and 24-hour urine aldosterone, sodium, and
    creatinine

    Management

- If benign appearing and not hormone producing: interval imaging in
    \~1 year, and repeat hormone work up

- Unilateral adrenal incidentaloma

<!-- -->

- If progression free (stable size, and not hormone producing) can
    consider monitoring cessation after 4 years

<!-- -->

- Pheochromocytomas should undergo surgical evaluation for removal

<!-- -->

- Alpha blockade (phenoxybenzamine) + propranolol prior to resection
    to avoid HTN crisis

<!-- -->

- Aldosteronoma: should undergo surgical evaluation for definitive
    treatment; if unable to undergo surgery can use mineralocorticoid
    antagonist (e.g. spironolactone)

- Cortisoloma: if clinically significant should undergo surgical
    removal, will need perioperative glucocorticoid administration to
    avoid iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency

- Macroadenomas (masses \>4 cm) are usually malignant and should be
    considered for surgical resection due to higher risk of carcinoma

- Bilateral adrenal incidentalomas

<!-- -->

- Surgical evaluation + will need adrenal venous sampling to confirm
    laterality in hormone producing tumors.

Additional information

- Not all hyperaldosterone states will have both HTN and hypokalemia

- Subclinical Cushing's syndrome may be present based on initial
    dexamethasone suppression test, perform additional testing to
    determine if clinically significant

Acute Abdominal Pain – Alex Mamunes

General Approach:

- Rule out life threatening causes: Obstruction, Perforation,
    Dissection, AAA rupture, Inferior MI, Ectopic Pregnancy

- History: pain quality/timing/location/severity, aggravating and
    alleviating factors (eating, bowel movements, position),
    nausea/emesis, bowel changes, flatus & prior episodes

- Initial labs: CBC, BMP, LFTs, INR, lactate, lipase, U/A, urine hCG

Nausea & Vomiting – Taylor Riggs

Etiology: VOMMIIT mnemonic

- <u>V</u>estibular: Labyrinthitis, vestibular neuritis, meniere’s
    disease, cerebellar stroke

- Obstruction: adhesions, hernia, volvulus, constipation, gastric
    outlet obstruction

- <u>M</u>otility: gastroparesis, GERD, autonomic dysfunction

- <u>M</u>edications: antibiotics, SSRI, opioids, cannabinoid
    hyperemesis

- <u>I</u>nfection: gastroenteritis, hepatitis, pyelonephritis,
    cholecystitis

- <u>I</u>nflammation: PUD, pancreatitis

- <u>T</u>oxins: uremia, ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, chemotherapy

Evaluation:

- All patients: CBC (leukocytosis, Hgb), BMP (AG, Ca, lytes, AKI),
    LFTs, lipase, lactate, UA

- If risk factors: consider TSH, AM cortisol, troponin, β hCG, UDS

- EKG to eval for ischemia and baseline QTc

- Imaging:

<!-- -->

- If concern for obstruction (abd distention, decreased BMs) KUB,
    consider CT A/P

- If concern for biliary pathology (RUQ pain, abnl LFTs) RUQ U/S

- If vestibular/concern for CNS pathology CTH vs MRI brain

Management: Address underlying cause and stop medications as appropriate

- Many antiemetics prolong QTc, however in patients without underlying
    cardiac conduction abnormality, electrolyte abnormality, or organ
    failure the risk of QTc prolongation leading to significant
    arrhythmia is low.

<!-- -->

- Obtain screening EKG in patients with underlying heart disease,
    electrolyte abnormalities, organ failure or on other QTc prolonging
    meds (antiarrhythmics, antipsychotics, antibiotics)

- 4-8 mg of IV Zofran is estimated to prolong QTc by \~6ms

<!-- -->

- Try to pick a medication that will address the underlying etiology
    of nausea

<!-- -->

- If patient does not respond to a medication in a certain class, try
    a medication from a different class (see below)

Diarrhea – Charles Oertli

Background

- \>3 BM/day OR abnormally loose stool

- Acute (\<2 weeks), persistent (2-4 weeks), or chronic (\>4 weeks)

- 95% of acute diarrhea is self-limited & no additional treatment
    needed

- Most cases of acute diarrhea are due to infections

- Non-infectious etiologies become more common with increasing
    duration

- Voluminous watery diarrhea more likely disorder of small bowel

- Small volume frequent diarrhea more likely disorder of colon

- Nocturnal diarrhea suggests an inflammatory or secretory etiology

Acute Diarrhea

Etiology

- Watery diarrhea: viral gastroenteritis (norovirus, rotavirus,
    enteric adenovirus), C. diff, C. perfringens, S. Aureus, Bacillus
    cereus, enterotoxigenic E. coli, Cryptosporidium, Listeria,
    Cyclospora, vibrio cholerae, (Giardia is typically more chronic),
    Tropheryma whipplei, COVID

- Inflammatory diarrhea: Salmonella, Campylobacter, Shigella, EHEC,
    Yersinia, E histolytica, invasive viruses (CMV, HSV), Non-cholera
    vibrio. Look for red flag symptoms (see below).

- Medications, specifically antibiotics

Presentation

- Evaluate for red flags (BATS are Vulnerable vampires)

<!-- -->

- <u>B</u>loody stools,

- <u>A</u>ntibiotics/Recent hospitalization

    - Any antibiotic can cause C. diff; the longer the treatment, the
        > more likely

    - Most common to cause C. diff: Clindamycin \>
        > Penicillins/Cephalosporins/Fluoroquinolones

- <u>T</u>oo many stools: \>6 unformed stools/day

- <u>S</u>epsis (Fever) or <u>S</u>evere abdominal pain

- <u>V</u>ulnerable (Age \>70 yr, immunocompromised, IVDU, IBD,
    pregnant, travel)

Evaluation

- All patients: CBC w/ diff and BMP to eval for leukocytosis (C.diff),
    AKI, electrolyte abnormalities, thrombocytopenia/anemia (HUS),
    eosinophilia (parasites)

- If red flag symptoms or diarrhea \> 7d: ESR/CRP, C.diff, GIPP

- If immunocompromised: consider CMV, MAC, microsporidia

- If abdominal pain: consider CT A/P with IV contrast

- If concern for IBD or hx of IBD: CT Enterography with PO and IV
    contrast

- Blood Cultures if febrile/septic

Management

- All patients: supportive care with PO or IVF, electrolyte repletion

- If C.diff negative or treatment for C.diff started, ok for
    symptomatic treatment with Loperamide

    - Start with Loperamide 4mg x1 then transition to 2mg QID (AC+HS)
        > (maximum 16mg/day)

- If fever or inflammatory symptoms and C.diff not back, ok for
    Bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) 30mL or 2 tablets q30min x8

- Indications for antibiotics:

<!-- -->

- GIPP negative for Shigella, 0157:H7 (can precipitate HUS) and
    salmonella (can prolong carrier state)

- Empiric antibiotic therapy ONLY if toxic appearance or high concern
    for progressive illness/decompensation

    - Ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID or levofloxacin 500 mg daily x 3-5 days

    - Azithromycin 500 mg daily x 3 days

    - Ampicillin + gentamicin used for pregnant women to cover for
        Listeria

- C. diff positive (see section below)

</table>

Evaluation

- Labs: CBC w/ diff, CMP, ESR/CRP, TSH, celiac serologies if high
    suspicion (anti-TTG)

- Spot fecal elastase Steatorrhea (greasy, malodorous stools that
    float)

- Colonoscopy indicated if alarm symptoms are present ( \>45 yrs and
    hasn’t had one, or \<45 yrs and concern for IBD, CMV, ischemic
    colitis or microscopic colitis)

- If concern for IBS: Rome IV criteria (see section on “IBS” below)

Management

- IBS: trial elimination diet/low FODMAP, antidiarrheals

- Pancreatic insufficiency: enzyme replacement (Creon), consult
    nutrition for assistance

- Celiac: eliminate gluten, will need outpatient nutrition follow-up

- Bile acid malabsorption: can try cholestyramine (can affect
    absorption of other meds)

Constipation – Chelsie Sievers

Background

- Definition: presence of lumpy/hard stools, straining, use of digital
    maneuvers, sensation of incomplete evacuation, frequency \<3 BM per
    week.

- Common etiologies: opioid-induced, medications (anti-depressants,
    iron, anticholinergics) hypothyroidism, hypokalemia, pregnancy, IBS,
    neurogenic (trauma, MS, Parkinson disease, diabetes, autonomic
    dysregulation).

- Always think about risk of obstruction (prior abdominal surgeries,
    oncology history or risk for GI/GU malignancies, history of
    IBD/Crohn’s).

Evaluation

- Evaluate etiologies plus lifestyle factors (low fiber intake, low
    fluid intake, reduced mobility, acute illness)

- Clinical diagnosis, no need for imaging unless concerned for
    obstruction → KUB/ CT

- BMP + Mg to evaluate electrolytes, consider TSH if chronic

- Rectal exam to exclude rectal mass or fecal impaction
    (constipation + diarrhea doesn’t exclude impaction/obstruction.
    Overflow around mass = encoparesis)

Management

- Stop or minimize offending medications if possible

- Optimize lifestyle factors: out of bed, walking hallways, increase
    fluid intake, + cup of coffee if appropriate.

- Escalating pathway: ensure meds are scheduled not PRN

    - MiraLAX (PEG) 17g BID (can give TID) + Senna nightly (can
        > increase to BID and/or 2 tabs) → Bisacodyl suppository → enema
        > (tap water or SMOG) → stronger osmotic laxative (lactulose
        > 20mg once, Mag-citrate, Golytely) → escalate lactulose dosing
        > 20 – 30 mg q2hrs

- Other considerations:

    - Avoid Fleet enemas (sodium-phosphate) in CKD and geriatric
        > populations

    - “The hand that writes for opioids also writes a bowel regimen”

        - Generally, start with scheduled MiraLAX (PEG) 17g daily +
            > senna nightly

        - If severe and unrelieved by escalating therapies, can try
            > methylnaltrexone

    - Lactulose can cause severe bloating and cramping

    - In patients unable to take PO: place DHT to deliver meds or
        > rectal lactulose (important for patients with cirrhosis with
        > AMS/HE).

    - In patients with CF (at risk for distal intestinal obstruction
        > syndrome): ensure have pancreatic enzymes ordered, managed
        > more like constipation than true obstruction: PO/ NGT MiraLAX
        > QID or Golytely.

    - Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome): \>12cm
        > cecal diameter = severe dilation, risk of perforation. Treated
        > with neostigmine, 2mg IV over 3 to 5 minutes. Monitor for
        > bradycardia, hypotension, and dysrhythmias (relative
        > contraindications: recent MI, asthma, PUD, epilepsy).
        > Decompression with colonoscopy used in some cases.

    - Consider pelvic floor dysfunction, pelvic floor PT may be
        > helpful

    initiation; associated w/sensation of food getting stuck in
    esophagus

<!-- -->

- Dysphagia to solids = mechanical obstruction

    - Foreign body: Inability to swallow solids and/or liquids,
        including oral secretions

        - Most common foreign body = food in esophagus

    - Progressive: esophageal stricture, peptic stricture, esophageal,
        cancer

    - Intermittent: esophageal ring/web, eosinophilic esophagitis
        (particularly in young pts)

- Dysphagia to solids and liquids = motility disorder

    - Causes: achalasia, scleroderma, distal esophageal spasm (DES),
        hypercontractile (nutcracker) esophagus

Evaluation

- If oropharyngeal dysphagia: videofluoroscopic modified barium
    swallow and fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES)

- When to order barium esophogram:

<!-- -->

- Pre-endoscopy if clinical history suspicious for proximal esophageal
    lesion (i.e. Zenker’s) or known complex stricture (post-caustic
    injury or radiation)

    - Don’t order if a food impaction is suspected or if imminent
        endoscopy

- Post-endoscopy if mechanical obstruction is still suspected (EGD can
    miss lower esophageal rings or extrinsic esophageal compression)

<!-- -->

- EGD if concerns for mechanical obstruction

- Manometry for motility disorders

Management

- Food impaction: IV glucagon to relax lower esophageal sphincter to
    allow food passage

<!-- -->

- Otherwise, requires urgent upper endoscopy for removal

<!-- -->

- Additional management is specific to the final diagnosis

Odynophagia

- Pain with swallowing

- Associated with esophagitis

PIECE mnemonic for esophagitis:

- Pill-induced: NSAIDs, ART, KCl, doxycycline, bisphosphonates

<!-- -->

- Discontinue culprit med or substitute with liquid formulation;
    prevent by taking culprit meds w/ 8oz water and sit upright for 30
    mins after

<!-- -->

- Infectious: usually in immunosuppressed pts

<!-- -->

- Candida esophagitis: most common in HIV or heme malignancies, pts on
    antibiotics and steroid use

    - Can exist without OP thrush

    - Diagnosis: white mucosal plaque-like lesions on EGD biopsy and
        culture

- HSV esophagitis. Occurs most commonly in solid organ, BMT transplant
    recipients, and immunosuppressed patients

    - Diagnosis: well-circumscribed ulcers on EGD, biopsy or brushings
        of ulcer edge

    - Rx: acyclovir 400mg PO five times daily for 14-21 days
        (immunocompromised) or acyclovir 5mg/kg IV q8h for 7-14 days if
        unable to tolerate PO; 200mg PO five times daily or 400mg PO
        three times daily for 7-10 days (immunocompetent)

- CMV esophagitis: suspect in HIV pts w/ CD4\<50

    - Diagnosis: linear/longitudinal ulcers on EGD, biopsy

    - Rx: ganciclovir 5mg/kg IV q12h for 21-42 days; change to PO once
        pt able to tolerate; If contraindication to ganciclovir
        (leukopenia, thrombocytopenia) can use Foscarnet. PO
        valganciclovir can be used in patients who can tolerate and
        absorb oral medications. Treatment duration is 3-6 weeks based
        on expert opinion and response to disease

<!-- -->

- Eosinophilic esophagitis (see below)

- Caustic: alkali-induced injury, acid-induced injury, acute period
    (several days) following esophageal radiofrequency ablation for
    Barrett’s.

- GERD (see below)

GERD

Background

- Condition that develops when reflux of stomach contents causes
    symptoms and/or complications

- Classified base on appearance of esophageal mucosa on EGD

<!-- -->

- Erosive esophagitis: endoscopically visible breaks in distal
    esophageal mucosa + GERD

- Nonerosive reflux disease: presence of symptoms of GERD without
    esophageal mucosal injury

Presentation

- Esophageal symptoms: heartburn, regurgitation, chest pain,
    dysphagia, globus sensation, odynophagia

- Extra-esophageal symptoms: chronic cough, hoarseness

- Complications: Esophageal stricture, Barrett’s esophagus, esophageal
    adenocarcinoma

Evaluation

- Dx can often be made clinically in pts with classic heartburn and/or
    regurgitation

- If dx uncertain, can perform ambulatory pH monitoring + impedance

- EGD indicated for the following:

<!-- -->

- Presence of alarm features (dysphagia, persistent vomiting, GI
    cancer in 1º relative, odynophagia, GI bleeding, weight loss, iron
    deficiency anemia, ≥age \> 60 y/o with new-onset GERD symptoms)

- Risk factors for Barrett’s esophagus (duration of GERD at least 5-10
    years \[must be present\], \>50 yo, male, white, hiatal hernia,
    obesity, nocturnal reflux, tobacco use, first-degree relative w/
    Barrett’s and/or adenocarcinoma)

- Abnormal UGI tract imaging (i.e. luminal abnormalities).

- Continued symptoms despite adequate PPI therapy

Management

- Lifestyle and dietary modifications in all pts (weight loss; elevate
    HOB; avoid precipitants such as fatty foods, caffeine, alcohol,
    spicy foods, large meals, late night meals)

<!-- -->

- Mild/intermittent symptoms (\<2 episodes/wk) and no erosive
    esophagitis step-up therapy q4-8 wks until symptoms are controlled,
    then continue for at least 8 wks:

- Low-dose H2RA prn standard dose H2RA BID (min 2 wks) discontinue
    H2RA and start daily low dose PPI standard dose PPI

<!-- -->

- Frequent symptoms (\>2 episodes/wk, and/or severe symptoms that
    impair QOL) step-down therapy in order to optimize symptom relief

<!-- -->

- Standard-dose PPI daily (8 wks) low-dose PPI daily H2RA (if
    mild/intermittent symptoms) stop if asymptomatic

    - PPIs should be prescribed at lowest dose and for shortest
        duration appropriate

    - Instruct patients on optimal PPI use: most effective at gastric
        acid suppression when taken 30-60 minutes before a meal

    - Taper if taking for \>6 months and plan to discontinue

<!-- -->

- Medications:

<!-- -->

- Low dose H2RA: famotidine 10mg BID

- Standard dose H2RA: famotidine 20mg BID

- Low dose PPI: omeprazole 10 mg daily

- Standard dose PPI: omeprazole 20 mg daily

Additional Information

- Erosive esophagitis and Barrett’s esophagus:

<!-- -->

- Require maintenance acid suppression with a standard dose PPI daily
    given likelihood of recurrent symptoms and complications if stopped

<!-- -->

- Recurrent Symptoms (2/3 of pts with nonerosive reflux disease
    relapse when acid suppression is discontinued):

<!-- -->

- If ≥3 months after discontinuing repeat 8-week course

- If \<3 months of discontinuing EGD (if not already performed) to
    rule out other etiologies or complications

Eosinophilic Esophagitis

Background

- Pt usually with a history of asthma/allergies/eczema

- Dysphagia (most commonly to solid foods), food impaction, central
    chest pain, GERD/refractory heartburn, upper abdominal pain

Evaluation

- Diagnostic criteria

<!-- -->

- Symptoms related to esophageal dysfunction

- EGD with \>15 eos/hpf on biopsy and exclusion of other causes

- 50-60% pts will have elevated serum IgE lvl; peripheral eosinophilia
    can be seen but is generally mild.

Management

- Standard dose PPI for 8 weeks +/- elimination diet if still
    symptomatic after 4 weeks, increase PPI to BID if responsive,
    continue PPI at lowest dose possible for symptom control

- Alternative treatment is swallowed budesonide or fluticasone

- Intermittent dilation of strictures to relieve dysphagia, but no
    effect on underlying inflammation

- Should undergo evaluation by allergist, given strong association
    with allergies

Peptic Ulcer Disease – Michelle Izmaylov

Background

- Ulceration in the GI tract wall extending through the muscularis
    mucosa into deeper layers

<!-- -->

- Most common in the stomach and proximal duodenum

- Less common in the lower esophagus, the distal duodenum, or the
    jejunum

    - ↑ suspicion for unopposed hypersecretory states, like
        Zollinger-Ellison syndrome

<!-- -->

- Causes: NSAID use and Helicobacter pylori \>\> steroids, malignancy,
    and acute stress

Presentation

- Episodic gnawing or burning epigastric pain, 2 - 5 hr after meals,
    nausea, vomiting, heartburn, bloating, postprandial belching, and
    loss of appetite

- Nocturnal pain: acid is secreted in absence of a food buffer

- Classic teaching for ulcers: Gastric (pain worse w/eating); Duodenal
    (pain better w/eating)

- May be asymptomatic until complications such as hemorrhage or
    perforation

- Alarm features: unintentional weight loss, persistent vomiting,
    melena, progressive dysphagia, early satiety, recurrent vomiting,
    palpable abdominal mass, lymphadenopathy, family history of upper
    gastrointestinal cancer, and iron deficiency anemia

Evaluation

- CBC and H Pylori testing if no strong NSAID use history

<!-- -->

- Urea breath or stool antigen (pt needs to stop PPI for 1-2 weeks, to
    avoid false - for both)

<!-- -->

- EGD: if alarm features or patient is older than 55

Management

- General: treat underlying cause (i.e. H. pylori, stop NSAIDs, etc),
    encourage smoking cessation, and limit alcohol intake to 1
    drink/day.

- If complicated peptic ulcer (i.e. bleeding, perforation, or gastric
    outlet obstruction):

<!-- -->

- EGD to determine etiology and for possible treatment

- IV PPI (if bleeding IV PPI for 72 hrs after endoscopic treatment
    oral PPI)

<!-- -->

- If uncomplicated peptic ulcer (not caused by H. pylori):

<!-- -->

- Antisecretory therapy with oral PPI (i.e. omeprazole 20 to 40 mg
    daily):

    - If caused by NSAIDs: Duration: \<1 cm ulcer 4-6 wks; ≥1 cm ulcer
        6-8 wks

    - If not caused by NSAIDs, Duration:

        - Duodenal ulcer: 4 weeks

        - Gastric ulcer: 8 weeks

<!-- -->

- If ulcer caused by H. pylori:

<!-- -->

- Treat with PPI BID for 14 days with an appropriate combination
    antibiotic regimen.

- Confirm H. pylori eradication (via stool antigen test, urease breath
    test, or EGD \>4 weeks after completion of therapy). If not
    eradicated, retreat

Additional Information

- Continue maintenance PPI therapy (omeprazole 20 mg daily) for the
    following:

<!-- -->

- Peptic ulcer \>2 cm and age \>50 or multiple co-morbidities

- Frequently recurrent peptic ulcers (\>2 in one year)

- H. pylori-negative, NSAID-negative ulcer disease

- Failure to eradicate H. pylori (including salvage therapy)

<!-- -->

- Persistent/recurrent symptoms despite medical therapy

- Complicated ulcer (bleeding), with evidence of ongoing bleeding

- Giant gastric ulcer (\>2 cm) or features of malignancy at index
    endoscopy

- Gastric ulcer that was not biopsied or inadequately sampled on
    initial EGD

- Gastric ulcer in pt w/risk factors for gastric cancer (\>50 yo, H.
    pylori, immigrant from high prevalence area \[Japan, Korea, Taiwan,
    Costa Rica\], FHx, presence of gastric atrophy, adenoma, dysplasia,
    intestinal metaplasia)

GI Bleeding – Matthew Meyers

Background

- Intraluminal blood loss anywhere from the nasopharynx/oral cavity to
    the anus

<!-- -->

- Don’t forget epistaxis or oropharyngeal bleeding as possible source
    of melena

<!-- -->

- IV PPI prior to endoscopy may ↓ need for endoscopic therapy but does
    not impact transfusion requirement, rebleeding risk, need for
    surgical intervention, or mortality

- Classification: relative location to the Ligament of Treitz (LoT)

<!-- -->

- Upper = proximal to LoT

    - PUD, gastritis (alcohol, stress, NSAIDs, ASA), esophagitis,
        variceal bleed, Mallory-Weiss tear, AVM, Dieulafoy’s lesion,
        aorto-enteric fistula, gastric antral vascular ectasias,
        malignancy

- Lower = distal to LoT

    - Diverticular bleed, ischemic/infectious/IBD/radiation colitis,
        malignancy, angiodysplasia, anorectal (hemorrhoids, anal
        fissure), Meckel’s diverticulum, post-polypectomy bleed

Presentation

- Hematemesis (very specific for upper GI bleed), hematochezia
    (usually lower although brisk upper possible), melena (usually
    upper), coffee-ground emesis, epigastric/abdominal pain, acute or
    chronic, hx of GI bleed and prior endoscopies, NSAID use, alcohol
    use, anticoagulant use, hx of cirrhosis

- Exam: VITALS – assess stability to determine resuscitation needs,
    MICU vs. floor; orthostatic vs, rectal exam every time (smear stool
    on white tissue paper to look for melena), look for signs of
    cirrhosis (jaundice, palmar erythema, ascites, spider angiomata)

Evaluation

- CBC, PT/INR, CMP, Lactic Acid, Blood Gas

- EGD: usually best

- Difficulty localizing GIB: pill-capsule, balloon enteroscopy
    Meckel’s scan, tagged RBC scan

- Massive lower GI bleeds will require arteriography

Management

- Secure airway (intubation) if comatose, extremely combative, or
    massive hematemesis

- At least 2 large bore IV’s (\> 18 gauge) – ask nurses directly to
    ensure these are placed

- Maintain active type and screen

- Bolus IVF to maintain MAP \>65H/H monitoring q6-q12 hours;
    transfusions as indicated

- IV PPI (pantoprazole) 40 mg BID if thought to be upper/possible
    ulcer

- If cirrhotic, Ceftriaxone 1g daily for empiric SBP prophylaxis

- If possibility of variceal bleed: Octreotide IV 50 mcg x1 then 50
    mcg/hr drip x 3-5 days

- NPO if unstable vs. clear liquids (no reds or purples) until morning
    for EGD

- Never give prep to a patient for colonoscopy (GoLytely) without
    discussing with GI fellow

- Consult gastroenterology to facilitate endoscopy

<!-- -->

- If endoscopy is unable to stop bleeding IR is next who can embolize

- If embolization fails EGS for source removal

Acute Pancreatitis – Alex Wiles

Background

- Common causes: Gallstones (40%), EtOH (30%)

- Other causes: post-ERCP, pancreatic cancer/obstruction, blunt
    abdominal trauma, hypertriglyceridemia (TG \>1000), hypercalcemia,
    drugs (thiazides, protease inhibitors, azathioprine, 6MP), mumps,
    Coxsackie, vasculitis, pregnancy, genetic (PRSS1, SPINK1, CFTR),
    autoimmune (IgG4), scorpion venom

- Several scoring systems:

<!-- -->

- BISAP (BUN \>25, Impaired mental status, SIRS, Age\>60, Pleural
    effusion)

    - 0 – 2 Mortality \< 2%; 3 - 5 Mortality \> 15 %

- APACHE II (MD Calc, several factors)

    - 0 – 8 Mortality \<4%; \> 8 Mortality 11 – 18 %

Presentation

- Must have 2 out of the three:

<!-- -->

- Pain characteristic of pancreatitis (sharp, epigastric, radiating to
    back)

- Imaging characteristic of pancreatitis (US, CT, MRI)

- Enzymes (lipase or amylase) \>3x ULN (use lipase, much more
    specific)

- \*If pain is characteristic and lipase \> 3x ULN, no need for CT A/P

<!-- -->

- Grading Severity:

<!-- -->

- Mild: no organ failure or systemic complications

- Moderate: transient organ failure (\<48 hours)

- Severe: persistent organ failure (\>48 hours)

Evaluation

- Lipase, CBC, CMP, lipid panel, lactate, direct bilirubin

- Obtain RUQ U/S for all pts, evaluates for gallstones

- CT A/P w/ IV contrast if indicated

<!-- -->

- Reserved for patients not improving at 48-72 hour to assess for
    complications

- If performed at onset, underestimates severity (necrosis takes 72
    hours from onset)

Management

- Fluids, Fluids, Fluids:

<!-- -->

- First 12-24 hrs: IVF at 200 to 500 cc/hr, or 5-10 cc/kg / hr (2.5 –
    > 4 L within first 24 hrs)

<!-- -->

- Follow HCT and BUN as markers for successful fluid resuscitation

- Aggressive IVF in first 24 hours reduces both morbidity and
    mortality

- Persistent hemoconcentration at 24 hr is associated with necrotizing
    pancreatitis

<!-- -->

- Pain Control:

<!-- -->

- Common starting narcotic regimen is oxycodone 10 mg q6h PRN and
    hydromorphone 0.5 mg q4h for breakthrough

<!-- -->

- Nutrition:

<!-- -->

- NPO but start PO diet as soon as patient can tolerate (even within
    24 hours)

- Clear liquid diet or mechanical soft and advance as tolerated

- Low fat diet (Fatty acids → CCK → trypsinogen to trypsin)

- If NPO \> 72 hours, attempt PO and if fail, place Dobhoff for
    enteral nutrition at latest by day five… outcomes with NG/NJ \>\>\>
    TPN

<!-- -->

- Antibiotics:

<!-- -->

- Fever, leukocytosis common, not an indication for ABX as the
    necrosis is sterile

- Infection of the necrosis should be suspected with failure to
    improve 7 days after onset

    - Cefepime + Flagyl or carbapenem

- EUS or IR guided drain for aspirate: can be done on immature
    collections for diagnostic purposes but typically only done if
    collection is walled-off—at least 4 weeks

- Endoscopic Intervention (cystogastrostomy) has emerged as first-line
    therapy for symptomatic pseudocysts or walled-off pancreatic
    necrosis , with step-up therapy to video assisted retroperitoneal
    debridement (VARD) or surgery when needed

Additional Information

- If choledocholithiasis on Imaging urgent ERCP for patients with
    cholangitis or obstructive jaundice, otherwise elective ERCP

- If Intermediate probability for choledocholithiasis MRCP or EUS or
    (for patients requiring cholecystectomy Intraoperative cholangiogram

- If biliary sludge but no stones on U/S, still consider
    cholecystectomy (likely microlithiasis)

- Complications:

<!-- -->

- ARDS, abdominal compartment syndrome, AKI, DIC

- \< 4 weeks after pancreatitis: Peripancreatic fluid collection,
    acute necrotic collection

- \> 6 weeks after pancreatitis: Pancreatic pseudocyst, walled-off
    necrosis (WON)

- Most fluid collections should be followed over time as acute
    collections can resolve and are unable to be sampled safely with EUS

<!-- -->

- Gallstone pancreatitis:

<!-- -->

- All pts should have cholecystectomy once recovered (recurrence is
    25-30%) with EGS

- Performed during initial admission in cases of mild acute
    pancreatitis

Chronic Pancreatitis – AJ De Witte

Definition: A syndrome characterized by irreversible chronic progressive
pancreatic inflammation, fibrosis, and scarring, resulting in damage to
and loss of exocrine (acinar), endocrine (islet cells), and ductal cells

Etiology: TIGAR-O mnemonic

- <u>T</u>oxic Metabolic: EtOH, tobacco use, hyperCa (Ca \> 12), HLD
    (fasting TG \> 300, nonfasting \> 500), CKD 5, medications, toxins

- <u>I</u>diopathic: early onset (age \< 35), late onset (age \> 35)

- <u>G</u>enetic: Autosomal dominant (PRSS1 gene), recessive (CFTR,
    SPINK1, etc.)

- <u>A</u>utoimmune: IgG4-related (AIP type 1), AIP type 2

- <u>R</u>ecurrent, severe acute pancreatitis

- <u>O</u>bstructive: pancreas divisum, ampullary stenosis, main duct
    pancreatic stones or strictures, widespread calcifications, mass
    causing duct obstruction

    Presentation:

- Abdominal pain (most common)

- Exocrine insufficiency: diarrhea, steatorrhea, weight loss

    - Typically occurs later in disease process

- Endocrine insufficiency: diabetes

- Occasionally asymptomatic

    Evaluation:

- Imaging: CT or MRI (may be negative early in course of disease)

    - If CT or MRI negative but suspicion for CP remains high,
        consider EUS +/- biopsy or secretin-enhanced MRCP

- Labs:

    - BMP, LFTs, lipid panel, PeTH

    - Consider genetic testing, especially in younger patients and/or
        patients without clear etiology

    - Pancreatic function testing diagnoses exocrine insufficiency but
        is not necessary for diagnosis of CP

        - Gold standard = 72-hour fecal fat (\> 7g of fat per 100g
            stool per day) - rarely done

        - More practical = fecal elastase (\<100 = diagnostic, 100-200
            = indeterminate)

            - Must be performed on formed stool, can be false positive
                If watery specimen

            - Do not have to stop pancreatic enzymes to measure

    - Lipase and amylase levels can be elevated, but are usually
        normal due to pancreatic scarring and fibrosis

        Management:

- Tobacco and EtOH cessation

- Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy if evidence/diagnosis of
    exocrine insufficiency

    - Usual dose: 50,000 units/meal + 25,000 units with snacks

    - Should take with first bite of a meal and consider adding extra
        enzymes or splitting up dose throughout meal if lasting longer
        than 15 mins

    - If lack of response: try increasing dose, confirm compliance,
        add PPI, split up dose throughout meal, look for concurrent GI
        disorders

- Pain: Tylenol + NSAIDs \> Opioids (Tramadol), consider SSRI/SNRI/TCA
    or gabapentin

    - For refractory pain, other options include celiac plexus
        blockade or total pancreatectomy with islet auto transplant

- Vitamin supplementation + Vit D + Ca

- Consider antioxidants (selenium, ascorbic acid, β-carotene, and
    methionine, vitamin E) – mixed evidence but some studies have shown
    improved pain control

- Routine testing for osteoporosis and fat-soluble vitamin
    deficiencies

Biliary Disease – Alex Wiles

Pearls:

- ERCP is not available at VA: requires fee-basis consult to VUMC,
    contact GI to arrange

- Prior cholecystectomy CBD normally dilates to 10 mm, not pathologic

- Pneumobilia generally indicates performance of prior biliary
    sphincterotomy and/or biliary stent

- CBD dilation classically \> 6mm, but CBD dilates with age: 70 yo
    7mm, 80 yo 8mm; opiates can also cause biliary dilatation

Biliary Colic

- Transient biliary obstruction typically at the GB neck without GB
    inflammation (no fever)

- Presentation: Constant (not colicky) intense, dull RUQ pain and N/V
    for 30 minutes to 6 hours, then resolves, provoked by fatty foods
    (CCK), absent Murphy’s sign

- Biliary colic generally consists of discrete episodes separated by
    weeks to months, and not daily pain

<!-- -->

- Evaluation: Normal (CBC, LFTs, Lipase, Lactate)

<!-- -->

- Imaging: RUQ U/S: cholelithiasis (stones in GB)

- Management: Elective cholecystectomy as outpatient

Acute Calculous Cholecystitis

- Inflammation of the GB from an obstructing stone in the GB neck or
    cystic duct

- Ddx: PUD, pancreatitis, choledocholithiasis, ascending cholangitis,
    IBD, Fitz-Hugh Curtis

- Presentation: Severe constant RUQ pain, fever/chills, N/V, + Murphy
    sign

- Evaluation: CBC (leukocytosis), CMP (mild AST/ALT ↑), Lipase,
    Lactate, BCx x2

- Imaging: RUQ U/S: gallstones + GB wall thickening or pericholecystic
    edema

<!-- -->

- If U/S non-diagnostic (no stones or GB inflammation) HIDA Scan (lack
    of GB filling)

Management: NPO, IVF, IV Abx until resolved or surgical removal

- Urgent Cholecystectomy (\<72H) with EGS;

<!-- -->

- If poor surgical candidate: Cholecystostomy with IR; endoscopic
    drainage options for selected patients (i.e. poor surgical
    candidates also with ascites)

- Complications: gangrenous cholecystitis, perforation, emphysematous
    cholecystitis, chole-cysto-enteric fistula, gallstone ileus

Acute Acalculous Cholecystitis

- Inflammation of the GB without obstructing stone (due to stasis and
    ischemia)

- Presentation: Seen in critically ill/ICU pts; similar history as
    above; may present as unexplained fever or RUQ mass (rarely
    jaundice)

- Ddx: calculous cholecystitis, pancreatitis, hepatic abscess

- Evaluation: Same as acute calculous cholecystitis

- Imaging: GB wall thickening, pericholecystic edema, intramural gas,
    GB distention

Management: Supportive care, antibiotics, GB drainage

- IVF, correct electrolyte abnormalities, NPO

- Broad spectrum antibiotic coverage

- Place CT-guided procedure consult for cholecystostomy placement vs
    Endoscopic drainage (transpapillary cystic duct stent via ERCP or
    cholecystoduodenostomy by EUS)

- Consult EGS if necrosis, perforation, or emphysematous changes
    present

Choledocholithiasis – Anton de Witte

- Obstruction of biliary outflow by CBD stone without inflammation (no
    fever)

<!-- -->

- Impacted cystic duct stone (cholecystitis) with compression of the
    CBD (Mirizzi syndrome)

<!-- -->

- Presentation: RUQ pain (can be painless), N/V and jaundice

- Evaluation: CMP and D-bili (Bili/ALP/ GGT ↑↑↑, AST/ALT mild ↑), CBC
    (Leukocytosis suggests cholangitis), Lipase

- Imaging: RUQ U/S: dilated CBD (ULN is 6mm) MRCP/EUS vs ERCP (see
    below)

<!-- -->

- MRCP preferred given non-invasive but has lower sensitivity for
    smaller stones (consider EUS if still have suspicion despite
    negative MRCP or if patient contraindication to/intolerance of MRI)

Management

- NPO & IVF, pain control PRN

- Stratify risk to determine whether to pursue MRCP (noninvasive,
    diagnostic) vs ERCP

- If any one of the following, patient is HIGH risk consult GI for
    > ERCP + EGS to consider cholecystectomy

<!-- -->

- CBD stone on imaging

- Acute cholangitis

- Tbili \> 4 AND dilated CBD (\>6mm with GB, \> 8mm without GB)

<!-- -->

- If any one of the following, patient is INTERMEDIATE risk consider
    > MRCP (or EUS or cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram)

<!-- -->

- Abnormal liver enzymes

- Age \> 55

- Dilated CBD on U/S with Tbili \< 4

<!-- -->

- If CBD stone seen on MRCP or EUS ERCP,

- If no CBD stone but patient has GB sludge or cholelithiasis EGS
    > consult for cholecystectomy + intraoperative cholangiogram

Acute Cholangitis

- Bacterial infection of biliary tract 2/2 obstruction (typically
    stones) or prior instrumentation (ERCP)

<!-- -->

- Pts with malignant obstruction typically do not develop cholangitis

<!-- -->

- Presentation: Charcot triad (RUQ pain, fever, jaundice); Reynolds’
    Pentad (AMS, Hypotension)

- Evaluation: CBC, CMP (D bili, ALP ↑↑↑) Blood Cultures, Lipase,
    Lactate

<!-- -->

- CRP, AST/ALT can be ↑↑ as well

<!-- -->

- Imaging: RUQ U/S: dilated CBD (ULN is 6mm), no need for MRCP/EUS

<!-- -->

- Consider MRCP overnight if ERCP is not being done emergently

Management:

- NPO, IVF

- Consult GI for urgent/emergent ERCP (generally within 24 hr)

- If ERCP not feasible or fails to establish biliary drainage, can
    consider EUS-guided biliary drainage, percutaneous transhepatic
    cholangiography, or surgical decompression

- Antibiotics for Biliary Disease (IDSA Guidelines):

<!-- -->

- Mild to moderate acute cholecystitis (stable):

    - Ceftriaxone 2g daily, Cefazolin 1-2g q8H

- Cholangitis or Severe acute cholecystitis (unstable or
    immunocompromised):

    - Zosyn 3.375g q8H, Meropenem 1g q8H or Cipro 500 q12H and Flagyl
        500 q8H

    - Healthcare-associated Biliary infections: consider Vancomycin
        (order w/ PK consult)

Gastroparesis – Hashim Hayat

Background

- Syndrome of objectively delayed gastric emptying in absence of
    mechanical obstruction

- Etiology: Diabetes (most common), post-surgical (gastric or
    bariatric surgery), thyroid dysfunction, autoimmune or neurologic
    disorders, medication-induced (GLP-1 agonists, narcotics,
    anticholinergic agents

Presentation

- Nausea, vomiting (may contain food eaten several hours prior),
    abdominal pain (dull, crampy; rarely a predominant symptom), early
    satiety, postprandial fullness, bloating, weight loss in severe
    cases

Evaluation

- Exclude mechanical obstruction and mucosal disease with CTE and EGD

- Scintigraphic gastric emptying study = gold standard for diagnosis
    (measures gastric retention of solids at 4h)

<!-- -->

- Stop medications that may affect gastric emptying 48 hrs prior to
    testing

- Must have blood sugar \< 275 (Hyperglycemia delays gastric emptying)

Management

- Support with IVF and electrolytes – PO intake preferred

- Glycemic control in diabetics

- Stop offending medications

- Nutrition consult for teaching on frequent small volume meals that
    are low in fat and soluble fiber

- If continued symptoms after above, try prokinetics and antiemetics

<!-- -->

- Prokinetics

    - Liquid formulations preferred for better absorption

    - Give 15min before meals and at bedtime.

    - First line is Reglan. If no response, try Domperidone and
        subsequently erythromycin (not good for long term, pts develop
        tachyphylaxis)

- Antiemetics: helps symptoms but do not improve gastric emptying

<!-- -->

- In severe cases patients may require enteral feeding (post pyloric
    preferred) or venting g-tube

- Emerging endoscopic treatment options: G-POEM (gastric peroral
    endoscopic myotomy)

Small Bowel Obstruction (SBO) – Alex Wiles

Background

- Risk Factors: prior abdominal surgeries (adhesions), malignancy,
    hernia, intestinal inflammation (IBD)/stricture, radiation, abscess,
    foreign bodies

- Indicators for bowel ischemia: fever, leukocytosis, tachycardia,
    peritonitis

- Ddx: early appendicitis, large bowel obstruction, Ogilvie’s, DKA,
    Pancreatitis, IBD, Gastric outlet obstruction

Presentation

- Nausea, emesis, intermittent colic, bloating, constipation

- Obstipation if completely obstructed, loss of flatulence

- Exam: classically with “tinkling” bowel sounds, tympanic abdomen,
    distended abdomen

Evaluation

- CBC, BMP, lipase, hepatic function panel, lactate (sensitive, not
    specific for ischemia)

- Start with KUB to rule out perforation but typically will require CT
    (x-ray only \~80% sensitive)

- CT abdomen/pelvis with IV contrast is optimal study if adequate
    renal function

<!-- -->

- No oral contrast (American College of Radiology (ACR)
    Appropriateness Criteria) as it will not aid diagnosis and can lead
    to aspiration; IV helps evaluate ischemia

- Key word: transition point

- Non-specific signs of bowel inflammation: bowel wall thickening,
    submucosal edema

Management

- Consult EGS: if any concern for SBO, evaluate need for urgent
    surgery

<!-- -->

- Surgical indications complete obstruction, CT with ischemia,
    perforation

<!-- -->

- Gastric decompression: place NGT (prevent aspiration)

- NPO until obstruction relieved and NGT removed

- Fluids: two large bore IVs (nursing communication); LR bolus +
    maintenance while NPO

- If no resolution of partial obstruction at 48 hours:

<!-- -->

- Fluoroscopy Upper GI small bowel ft (follow through)

    - In comments, write “Gastrografin contrast” (water-soluble
        contrast) which osmotically reduces bowel wall edema and aids
        peristalsis

    - If gastrografin reaches the colon within 24 hours, it predicts
        clinical resolution of SBO without surgery

    - Note this can also be therapeutic for pSBO and get bowels moving

Clostridioides Difficile Infections – Anton de Witte

Background

- *Clostridioides difficile* is the causative bacteria for
    antibiotic-associated colitis

- Always consider C. diff in a hospitalized patient with unexplained
    leukocytosis

- Microbiology: Anaerobic gram-positive, spore-forming,
    toxin-producing bacillus

<!-- -->

- Outside colon, exists in spore form – resistant to heat, acid, and
    antibiotics (why we must wash our hands)

- Spores are transferred from environment to person, once in intestine
    convert to functional vegetative, toxin-producing forms susceptible
    to antibiotics

- To be pathogenic, must release toxin (A+B) to cause colitis and
    diarrhea

<!-- -->

- Risk Factors: Antibiotic use (during use or typically up to 1 month
    after use), age \>65, hospitalization, enteral feeding, obesity,
    stem cell transplant, chemo, IBD, cirrhosis, +/- PPI use (no clear
    causal relationship)

Presentation

- Spectrum from asymptomatic carrier to fulminant colitis with toxic
    megacolon

<!-- -->

- Asymptomatic carrier: 20% of hospitalized patients (50% of adults in
    long term care facilities)

- Non-severe disease: watery diarrhea (\>3 unformed stools in 24
    hours), lower abdominal pain, nausea, ± fever, leukocytosis (WBC
    \>15,000)

- Severe disease: diarrhea, diffuse abdominal pain, abdominal
    distention, fever, lactic acidosis, AKI (Cr \> 1.5), marked
    leukocytosis (sometimes \>40,000)

- Fulminant disease: Severe criteria + hypotension/shock, ileus
    (rare), or megacolon (\>7cm colon diameter and/or \>12cm cecum
    diameter)

<!-- -->

- Recurrent disease (relapse \> reinfection): resolution of symptoms
    on therapy followed by reappearance of symptoms within 2-8 weeks
    after stopping therapy; (Up to 25% of patients have recurrence)

- If symptoms never resolve, consider refractory C. diff or
    alternative diagnosis

Evaluation

- Stool PCR for toxigenic strains (very sensitive, can detect
    asymptomatic carriers w/o toxin production); with reflex EIA (enzyme
    immunoassay) for toxins A and B (specificity of 99%)

<!-- -->

- PCR (+)/Toxin (-) = carrier

- PCR (+)/Toxin (+) = treat

- PCR (-) = no treatment

<!-- -->

- Imaging

<!-- -->

- Nonsevere disease: no imaging necessary

- Severe or fulminant disease: CT a/p with oral and IV contrast

<!-- -->

- Endoscopy: Typically used when alternative diagnosis is suspected;
    not warranted for classical symptoms, positive laboratory tests, or
    clinical response to treatment

Management

- Contact precautions until at least 48 hours after diarrhea resolves

- Classify patient disease severity to guide treatment algorithm

- Do not repeat stool testing – 50% remain positive after treatment up
    to 6 weeks later

Inflammatory Bowel Disease – Francesca Raffa

Background

- Ulcerative colitis (UC): colon only (can have backwash ileitis);
    contiguous lesions; mucosal inflammation

- Crohn’s disease (CD): any part of the GI tract; “skip lesions”;
    transmural inflammation

- Important historical considerations to include in your documentation
    and presentation:

<!-- -->

- Location of disease (CD: LB/SB, LB only, SB only; UC: proctitis,
    left-sided or pancolitis)

- Complications: Fistulizing, strictures, perianal, prior surgeries,
    current IBD treatment

- Include last endoscopies and imaging findings; current and prior IBD
    treatment and reason for transition (SEs, failure), primary IBD
    provider

Presentation

- UC: frequent diarrhea (often bloody), tenesmus, urgency, abdominal
    pain; may have fever, malaise, and weight loss

<!-- -->

- Complications: severe bleeding/anemia, fulminant colitis, toxic
    megacolon

<!-- -->

- CD: abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, fever, malaise, weight loss;
    May also have diarrhea (± bloody depending on CD location)

<!-- -->

- Complications: fistulas (entero-enteric, entero-vesicular,
    entero-cutaneous, rectovaginal, perianal, retroperitoneal),
    abscesses, strictures, obstruction

<!-- -->

- Extra-intestinal (EI): arthritis, sacro-iliitis, uveitis,
    episcleritis, aphthous ulcers, erythema nodosum, pyoderma
    gangrenosum, PSC (esp. UC), nephrolithiasis, thromboembolism

Evaluation

- CBC w/diff, CMP, CRP, ESR, ± blood cultures

- If diarrhea: GI Pathogen panel and C. diff

- If anemic: obtain iron studies and type & screen

- If weight loss or concern for malnutrition: albumin, pre-albumin,
    Vitamin D, B12, folate

- Imaging:

<!-- -->

- CT Enterography (oral contrast) preferred in CD, for
    luminal/extra-luminal complications

- How to order CTE: “CT abdomen pelvis enterography”, order barium
    (Volumen) 0.1% oral suspension x2, 1st dose to be given by nurse 60
    min before study, 2nd study to be given 30 min before (nurse should
    be in contact with CT tech)

Management

- Acute Flare

<!-- -->

- Pain control: usually a major component of hospital course

    - Avoid NSAIDs, oral pain medications are preferred

    - If pain is difficult to control, consider Acute Pain Service
        consult

    - Narcotics and Imodium are contraindicated in toxic megacolon

- Antibiotics: appropriately treat infections (intra-abdominal or
    perianal abscess) with antibiotics (consider prior culture data,
    often use cipro/flagyl)

- VTE Prophylaxis: All IBD patients, even if having blood in stool
    (unless requiring transfusion) as they are at much higher risk of
    VTE

- Nutrition: Nutrition consult for all IBD patients; For severe
    malnutrition or if prolonged bowel rest is needed, TPN is sometimes
    initiated

- Anemia: Ferritin \<100 or iron sat \<20 with ferritin \<300,
    consider iron infusions (if no bacteremia) or transfuse for severe
    anemia

- Smoking Cessation (esp. with CD): discuss smoking cessation &
    consult tobacco cessation

- Consult Colorectal Surgery (not EGS): SBO, toxic megacolon, bowel
    perforation, peritonitis

<!-- -->

- Immunosuppression: (Infections must be ruled out and/or treated
    before starting)

<!-- -->

- Steroids:

    - Methylprednisolone (Solumedrol); often 20 mg BID for three days

    - Transition to oral (40 mg prednisone daily) once clinically
        improved/tolerating PO; typically prescribe a prolonged taper on
        discharge (often down by 5 mg every week)

    - If severe proctitis: consider rectal steroids (hydrocortisone
        enema/foam)

- If lack of response to steroids: additional medical therapy
    (biologics), bowel rest with TPN, or surgical intervention

    - Infliximab (Inflectra) is available at VUMC

    - If patient fails to respond to steroids, should consider
        possibility of CMV colitis (usually evaluated by biopsy on flex
        sig or colonoscopy)

    - Prior to initiating a biologic, all patients must have the
        following negative studies within the last year: Quantiferon
        Gold and CXR, Hepatitis B serologies, HIV, urine histoplasma Ag
        (some providers)

Acute Diverticulitis – Michael Koenig

Background

- Inflammation and/or infection of a diverticulum, a small
    out-pouching along wall of colon

- Presence of colonic flora on urine culture or pneumaturia suggests
    colovesical fistula

- Most pts with uncomplicated diverticulitis have significant
    improvement 2-3 days after antibiotics

Presentation

- Lower abdominal pain (85% LLQ), tenderness to palpation on exam,
    N/V, low-grade fever, change in bowel habits (constipation or
    diarrhea)

Evaluation

- CBC w/diff, CMP, Lipase, U/A, β - hCG

- Imaging: CT abdomen/pelvis with oral and IV contrast

<!-- -->

- CT findings: localized bowel wall thickening (\>4mm), paracolic fat
    stranding, presence of colonic diverticula

Management

- Bowel rest vs. clear liquids (advance diet as tolerated)

- PO or IV antibiotics: should cover GNRs and anaerobic organisms

<!-- -->

- Zosyn, cefepime + metronidazole, or meropenem (if high risk for
    organisms w/ESBL)

- Cipro/flagyl if PO

- If low risk and mild disease, may not need antibiotics

<!-- -->

- Continue IV abx until abdominal pain/tenderness is resolved (usually
    3-5 days), then transition to oral: cipro + metronidazole or
    Augmentin to complete 10-14 d course

- Colonoscopy after complete resolution of symptoms (6 – 8 weeks) to
    definitively rule out presence of underlying colorectal cancer
    (unless performed in last year)

Complications:

- Pts who fail to improve or deteriorate require repeat imaging

- Abscess continue antibiotics & percutaneous drainage (if possible)
    for abscesses \> 4 cm

<!-- -->

- Surgery if no improvement 2-3 days after drainage

<!-- -->

- Obstruction: radiographic differentiation between acute
    diverticulitis and colon cancer is difficult; thus surgical
    resection of bowel is needed to relieve obstruction and rule out
    cancer

- Fistula: Rarely heal spontaneously, require surgical correction

- Perforation:

<!-- -->

- Microperforation (contained perforation):

    - Presence of small amount of air bubbles, but no oral contrast
        outside of colon on CT

    - Most treated with IV abx and bowel rest like uncomplicated
        diverticulitis

- Frank perforation:

    - Intraabdominal free air, diffuse peritonitis requires emergency
        surgery

Intestinal Ischemia – Michael Koenig

Acute Mesenteric Ischemia

- Sudden onset ↓ or absence of blood flow to the small intestines

- Mesenteric Arterial Occlusion:

<!-- -->

- Arterial Embolism: Associated with cardiac arrhythmias (atrial
    fibrillation), valvular disease, endocarditis, ventricular aneurysm,
    aortic atherosclerosis, and aortic aneurysm

- Arterial thrombosis: Most commonly from atherosclerotic disease; can
    also be 2/2 abdominal trauma, infection, or dissection

<!-- -->

- Venous thrombosis:

<!-- -->

- Associated w/ hypercoagulable states, malignancy, prior abdominal
    surgery, abdominal mass venous compression, intra-abdominal
    inflammatory processes

<!-- -->

- Non occlusive mesenteric ischemia:

<!-- -->

- Intestinal hypoperfusion and vasoconstriction; associated with
    decreased cardiac output, sepsis, vasopressor use

Presentation

- Early: Abdominal pain is most common symptom, abdominal distension

<!-- -->

- Abdominal tenderness is not prominent early (“pain out of proportion
    to the exam”)

<!-- -->

- Arterial occlusion: Sudden onset, severe periumbilical pain, nausea,
    and emesis

- Venous thrombosis: More insidious onset abdominal pain, waxing and
    waning

- Nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia: variable location and severity of
    abdominal pain; often overshadowed by a precipitating disorder

- Late: As transmural bowel infarction develops, abdomen becomes
    distended, bowel sounds become absent, and peritoneal signs develop 

Evaluation

- Type and Screen, Lactic acid, BMP, CBC

- Imaging: KUB: Normal in \> 25% of cases

<!-- -->

- Ileus w/ distended bowel loops, bowel wall thickening, ± pneumatosis
    intestinalis

- Free intraperitoneal air immediate abdominal exploration

<!-- -->

- CT Angiography: no oral contrast, obscures mesenteric vessels, ↓
    bowel wall enhancement

<!-- -->

- Focal or segmental bowel wall thickening, intestinal pneumatosis,
    portal vein gas, porto-mesenteric thrombosis, mesenteric arterial
    calcification, mesenteric artery occlusion

Management

- General: IVFs, NPO, hemodynamic monitoring and support (try to avoid
    vasoconstricting agents), anticoagulation, broad-spectrum
    antibiotics, pain control

- If develops peritonitis or evidence of perforation on CT EGS consult
    for surgery

- Mesenteric arterial embolism: Embolectomy vs. local infusion of
    thrombolytic agent

- Mesenteric arterial thrombosis: Surgical revascularization vs.
    thrombolysis with endovascular angioplasty and stenting

- Venous thrombosis: Anticoagulation; possible thrombolysis if
    persistent symptoms

- Nonocclusive occlusion: Treat underlying cause, stop
    vasoconstriction meds, consider intra-arterial vasodilator infusion

Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia

Background

- ↓ blood flow to intestines, typically caused by atherosclerosis of
    mesenteric vessel

- High-grade mesenteric vascular stenoses in at least two major
    vessels (celiac, SMA, or IMA) must be established

Presentation

- Recurrent dull, crampy, postprandial abdominal pain

- Pts develop food aversion and often have associated weight loss

Evaluation

- CTA abdomen/pelvis is preferred (\>90% sensitivity and specificity)

- Can also consider duplex U/S and gastric tonometry

Management

- Conservative management if asymptomatic: smoking cessation and
    secondary prevention to limit progression of atherosclerotic disease

- Nutritional evaluation

- Revascularization (open vs. endovascular) is indicated if symptoms
    are present

<!-- -->

- Mesenteric angioplasty and stenting is first-line therapy

- Goal is to prevent future bowel infarction

Ischemic Colitis

Background

- Sudden, transient reduction in blood flow to colon

- Typically at “watershed” areas, such as the splenic flexure and
    rectosigmoid junction

- Most often nonocclusive (95% of cases) and affects older adults

- Risk factors: ACS, hemodialysis, shock, aortoiliac instrumentation,
    cardiopulmonary bypass, extreme exercise (marathon running)

Presentation

- Rapid onset, mild cramping abdominal pain, associated with urge to
    defecate, hematochezia

- Tenderness present (typically over left side)

Evaluation

- Lactic acid (nonspecific but elevated), LDH, CPK, CBC
    (leukocytosis), BMP (metabolic acidosis)

- KUB; if peritonitis or signs of severe ischemia → surgery 

- CT A/P with IV contrast (and oral contrast if patient can tolerate)

- Consider CTA A/P if suspicion for vascular occlusion

- Colonoscopy confirms diagnosis. 

<!-- -->

- Edematous, friable mucosa; erythema; and interspersed pale areas;
    bluish hemorrhagic nodules representing submucosal bleeding

- Segmental distribution, abrupt transition between injured and
    non-injured mucosa

Management

- General: IVFs, bowel rest, antibiotics (Zosyn vs CTX/flagyl)

Irritable Bowel Syndrome – Hashim Hayat

Background

- Diagnose by the Rome IV criteria, no longer a diagnosis of exclusion

<!-- -->

- Recurrent abdominal pain on average at least 1 day/week in the last
    3 months with an onset at least 6 months prior, associated
    with **two or more** of the following criteria

    - Pain related to defecation

    - Change in frequency of stool

    - Change in form (appearance) of stool

- Patient has none of the following warning signs: \>50yrs, evidence
    of GIB, nocturnal pain or BMs, unintentional weight loss, family hx
    of colorectal cancer or IBD, palpable abdominal mass or LAD, IDA,
    +FOBT

- Classified based on predominant bowel habits

    - Diarrhea: \>25% BMs with Bristol stool types 6 or 7

    - Constipation: \>25% BMs with Bristol stool types 1 or 2

    - Mixed: both of above

Evaluation

- Thorough H&P for alarm symptoms as above

- Consider limited testing with CBC, CMP, CRP, celiac serology, fecal
    calprotectin

Management

- Treatment involves lifestyle and dietary modifications, psychosocial
    treatment, and pharmacologic treatment

- Pain:

<!-- -->

- Peppermint oil (smooth muscle relaxant) – IBGuard, Iberogast

- Antispasmodics: Hyosciamine acts faster than Dicyclomine

- TCAs: Amitriptyline or nortriptyline (causes less constipation so
    better in IBS-C)

<!-- -->

- Bloating:

<!-- -->

- Low FODMAP diet

- Rifaximin as empiric treatment for SIBO

- No evidence for probiotics (can potentially worsen bloating 2/2
    SIBO)

<!-- -->

- Bowel regulation:

<!-- -->

- IBS-D: Start with Loperamide (up to 16g daily), consider Lomotil if
    refractory

- IBS-C: Miralax, fiber supplement (Ispaghula husk orange), Linzess
    (first line but can be expensive), Trulance, or Amitiza

<!-- -->

- Other

<!-- -->

- Psychotherapy, CBT

- SSRIs, SNRIs for concomitant mood disorders

- Gabapentin, lyrica

GI Manifestations of COVID – Taylor Riggs

Background

- GI manifestations are reported up to 60% of patients with COVID

- GI symptoms may be the only symptom or precede other symptoms

- GI manifestations are felt to be due to expression of ACE2 receptor
    throughout the GI tract

Presentation

- Diarrhea – more common in severe disease

<!-- -->

- \~20% have diarrhea as first symptom of COVID; on average, lasts
    about 5 days

<!-- -->

- Nausea and vomiting – associated with more severe disease

- Mesenteric ischemia – likely due to intestinal microvascular injury

- Elevated liver enzymes – likely due to inflammatory response and
    direct virus-related toxicity

<!-- -->

- Hepatocellular pattern of injury most common; elevated bilirubin
    seen in severe disease

- Usually self-limited

<!-- -->

- Pancreatitis has been reported in several cases, but no causal link
    has been established

Management

- Largely supportive care

- Monitor LFTs, coags, consider checking lipase if abdominal pain

- If LFTs not improving after several days or underlying chronic liver
    disease, obtain RUQ U/S, consider hepatitis serologies

- Consider medications/antiviral medications as culprit and
    discontinue as indicated

Vanderbilt’s FACETS Inpatient Geriatrics Curriculum: <https://sites.google.com/view/facetscourse>

Physiological Changes with Aging

- **Cardiovascular**: Decreased vascular compliance and increased
    stiffness (intimal thickening). Decreased cardiac output. Maximum
    achievable HR decreases. Increase in systolic BP with decrease in
    diastolic BP (wider PP).

- **Endocrine/Immune:** Impairment of glucose tolerance (insulin
    resistance). Decreased sympathetic response to stress. Impairment of
    T-cell immunity and increased susceptibility to infection.

- **Gastrointestinal:** Decreased GI absorption, gastric emptying,
    motility, acid secretion, and hepatic blood flow. Reduced appetite
    and alterations of taste and smell.

- **Musculoskeletal:** Decreased bone density, muscle mass and
    strength. Increased fracture risk.

- **Neurologic:** Reduced cortical volume. Blunted vision, auditory
    function, and vibrotactile sensation. Decreased autonomic neural
    response. Slowed cognition and reflexes.

- **Pulmonary:** Increased chest wall rigidity. Decreased respiratory
    muscle strength. Decreased FEV1; FVC. Diminished ventilatory
    response to hypercapnia and hypoxia.

- **Renal:** Increased glomerulosclerosis. Decreased GFR and renal
    clearance of drugs/metabolites (↓ 1mL/min per year after age 40; Cr
    may stay the same due to reduced muscle mass). Reduced tubular
    function.

Dementia

Background

- **Alzheimer’s Disease (AD)**: short-term memory deficits prominent

- **Vascular Dementia**: “Stepwise decline” in memory and functional
    status

- **Lewy Body Dementia**: hallucinations, memory difficulties with
    atypical Parkinsonism early

- **Frontotemporal Dementia**: behavioral (aggressive or
    disinhibited), language (primary progressive aphasias) or memory
    (Alzheimer’s/FTD overlap) variants

- **Posterior Cortical Atrophy**: visual difficulties and ocular
    apraxia preceding memory problems

- **Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD)**: manifests with subacute
    cognitive decline, seizures, vision loss, personality changes. Can
    develop startle myoclonus

- **Corticobasal degeneration**: focal neurologic changes with
    parkinsonism

- **Neurosyphilis**: rare, but treatable, present with a range of
    cognitive changes. Develop meningovascular encephalitis. Pts can
    develop an arteritis, headache, and hydrocephalus.

- **Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH)**: “wet, wacky and wobbly”
    meaning incontinence, gait apraxia and cognitive changes (usually
    frontal symptoms)

- **Autoimmune Dementias**: includes limbic encephalitis (like NMDA)
    where there are memory and personality changes, autonomic changes,
    hallucinations, and seizures

- MOCA: Montreal Cognitive Assessment

<!-- -->

- Lengthier test of cognition (but highly specific for cognitive
    impairment)

- Useful for detecting subtle deficits as in Mild Cognitive Impairment
    (MCI)

- Scores:

    - 18-25: Mild cognitive impairment

    - 10-17: Moderate cognitive impairment

    - \<10: Severe cognitive impairment

<!-- -->

- Rule out reversible causes of dementia-like symptoms: **DEMENTIA**

<!-- -->

- Drugs

- Emotional (depression)

- Metabolic (CHF, COPD, CKD, OSA)

- Endocrine (hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, hyponatremia)

- Nutrition (B12 deficiency)

- Trauma (chronic SDH)

- Infection

- Arterial (vascular)

<!-- -->

- B12, thyroid studies

- RPR, HIV testing in at-risk patient groups

<!-- -->

- Neuropsych testing can be done for more clear patterns of
    dysfunction

<!-- -->

- MRI brain with contrast if concerned for inflammatory or infectious
    causes

<!-- -->

- CJD: cortical ribboning on DWI with T2 hyperintensity in the
    thalamus and basal ganglia

- Sulcal crowding and bowing of the corpus callosum can be seen in NPH
    on imaging

Management

- Targeting Cognitive Impairment

<!-- -->

- Cholinesterase Inhibitors: Donepezil, rivastigmine

    - Indicated for any stage (except FTD)

    - SE: GI (nausea, diarrhea), bradycardia, orthostasis

- NMDA antagonists: Memantine

    - Indicated in moderate to severe AD in combination with
        cholinesterase inhibitors

    - Fewer SE than cholinergic medications

- Vitamin supplementation (i.e. Vitamin E)

    - Unclear benefit in delaying progression of dementia

<!-- -->

- Targeting Behaviors

<!-- -->

- Non-pharmacologic management has the best evidence of effectiveness

- Depression: Treat with antidepressants (SSRI’s)

- Sleep Disturbance: Mirtazapine (7.5 mg nightly) or Trazodone (25 mg
    nightly)

- Agitation: Try SSRI (citalopram, sertraline)

    - Consider antipsychotics (black box warning increased risk of
        death in elderly)

Malnutrition

Background

- Needs to meet two or more of following criteria:

<!-- -->

- Insufficient calorie intake

- Weight loss

- Loss of muscle mass

- Loss of subcutaneous fat

- Localized fluid accumulation that may mask weight loss

- Diminished functional status as measured in handgrip strength

<!-- -->

- Reversible causes of malnutrition:

<!-- -->

- Food security (poverty), dental status (dentition, gum health),
    dietary restrictions, food-related functional status (shop, prepare
    meals, feed self), depression, dementia, alcoholism, swallowing
    ability

Evaluation

- Assess for depression

- Screening with Mini Nutritional Assessment (good sensitivity and
    specificity)

- Order: CBC, CMP, TSH

- Nutritional deficiencies: B12, folate, vitamin D

- Consider CT C/A/P depending on history

- Refeeding: K, Phos, Mg BID until stable and no longer having to
    replete

Management

- Manage reversible causes of malnutrition as above

- Medications: consider Remeron (7.5 mg nightly). Avoid Megace (NNH =
    23 for death)

- Liberalize dietary restrictions

- Nutritional Supplementation: Oral enteral supplements (i.e.
    nutritional shakes)

Falls

Background

- Screen annually for falls in the past year

<!-- -->

- History of fall is a strong risk factor for future falls

- Recommended History Screening Tool: CDC STEADI Algorithm

<!-- -->

- Physical Exam Screening Tools:

<!-- -->

- If potentially unstable injuries (new spine fracture or lower
    extremity fracture): Ask ortho to clear the patient for mobility

- If no potentially unstable injuries, attempt to get the patient out
    of bed

    - If lying down, have them lift each leg off the bed

    - If they can do this, ask them to sit up on side of bed

    - If they can do this, ask them to stand

    - If they can do this without assistance, then observe them walk

- The Timed “up and Go” Test (TUG) tool for fall risk

    - Have the patient rise from sitting in a chair, walk 10 feet
        forward, turn around, walk back to chair, and sit down

    - Patients who require \> 10 seconds are at increased risk for
        falls

<!-- -->

- Med Rec:

<!-- -->

- Antipsychotics, antidepressants, anticholinergics, anxiolytics,
    sedatives/hypnotics, anti-hypertensives, antiarrhythmics, steroids,
    statins all can increase risk of falls

Management

- Rule out other causes: Cardiac, Neurologic, Infectious

- Check Vitamin D levels (goal \> 30) and supplement (800-1000 IU
    daily) if at increased fall risk

- Assess visual acuity (e.g. expedite cataract surgery)

- Hearing assessment (audiology screen)

- Consult Inpatient PT/OT and refer for HH PT/OT for home safety
    evaluation at discharge

- Recommend non-skid shoes with a backing (sneaker)

- Modify extrinsic risk factors for falls: removal of fall hazards,
    placement of handrails

- Referral to Exercise programs: At VUMC = Dayani Center “Ambulatory
    Referral to Medical Fitness” outpatient order

Functional Status

Background

- Functional status: Ability to perform activities necessary in daily
    life (ADL)

    Geriatric depression scale.

- Vulnerable Elders Scale-13: Identifies community dwelling pts at
    risk for decline over 5 yrs

- Functional decline is not normal with aging and warrants detailed
    physical, cognitive, and psychosocial evaluations

Frailty

Background

- Syndrome of physiological decline in late life, characterized by
    marked vulnerability to adverse health outcomes

    Evaluation

- FRAIL Scale Identifies frailty in community dwelling elders (1 -2 =
    prefrail; \> 3 = frail)

<!-- -->

- Fatigue: are you Fatigued more often than not?

- Resistance: are you able to climb a flight of stairs?

- Aerobic: are you bale to walk a block?

- Illness: Do you have more than five illnesses?

- Loss: Have you lost more than 5% of weight in 6 months?

<!-- -->

- Order Vitamin D and B-12 Levels.

    Management

<!-- -->

- Adapt interventions to the individual, incorporating patient
    preferences and stage on the spectrum of frailty

- Exercise programs with additional physical and occupational therapy
    input if indicated.

- Optimize nutrition via supplementation (Vit D, B12)

- Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment; Outpatient PACE

Medication Management

- Medication Reconciliation Upon Admission

<!-- -->

- Evaluating for Polypharmacy – Beer’s Criteria

<!-- -->

- Pharmacologic changes in the elderly

<!-- -->

- Pharmacokinetic (PK): Decreased hepatic and renal clearance.
    Reduction in first pass metabolism. Drug distribution changes due to
    decreased TBW and lean body mass resulting in relative increase in
    fat.

- Pharmacodynamic (PD): Exaggerated responses to pharmacologic therapy
    (therapeutic and adverse effects).

<!-- -->

- Avoid Prescribing Defaults:

<!-- -->

- NSAIDs can lead to gastritis, which can lead to prescription of PPI

- Diuretics can lead to urinary incontinence, which can lead to
    prescription of oxybutynin

- HCTZ can lead to hyperuricemia which can lead to prescription of
    allopurinol

Anemia – Margaret Wheless

Presentation

- Symptoms:

<!-- -->

- Fatigue/malaise, dyspnea on exertion, angina (if history of CAD)

<!-- -->

- Signs:

<!-- -->

- Pallor, tachycardia, orthostatic hypotension, purpura, glossitis,
    koilonychia (in IDA)

- Jaundice (if hemolysis)

- Splenomegaly: suggests extramedullary hematopoiesis or sequestration

- Neurologic symptoms: suggests B12 deficiency

Evaluation

- CBC w/diff, reticulocyte count, peripheral blood smear, Iron studies
    (TIBC, Ferritin)

<!-- -->

- RI \> 2%: blood loss vs hemolysis; see below

    - Hemolysis labs: Bilirubin, LDH, haptoglobin

- RI \< 2%: hypoproliferative stratify based on RBC size

    - Microcytic (\<80) vs. Normocytic (80-100) vs. Macrocytic (\>100)

Reticulocyte Index \> 2%

Background

- Etiology: Consumption vs Blood loss

<!-- -->

- Loss: acute bleed vs iatrogenic from labs

- Hemolysis: Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA), autoimmune
    hemolytic anemia (AIHA), intrinsic RBC defects

Evaluation

- LDH, ↑indirect bilirubin, ↓haptoglobin, PT/PTT

- Peripheral blood smear: evaluated for schistocytes, bite cells, spur
    cells, spherocytes, etc.

- Direct antiglobulin test (DAT) to evaluate for autoimmune hemolytic
    anemia

Extrinsic RBC causes:

- If schistocytes ± thrombocytopenia = MAHA: TTP, DIC, HUS, HELLP,
    mechanical valves, malignant HTN, cocaine, scleroderma renal crisis

- If DAT positive = AIHA

Intrinsic RBC causes:

- Sickle cell disease: chronic hemolysis + splenic sequestration
    crisis where RI is↑ vs aplastic crisis where RI is↓ (see sickle cell
    section)

- Hereditary spherocytosis

- Hereditary elliptocytosis

- PNH

- G6PD: bite cells, Heinz bodies

<!-- -->

- Usually precipitated by drugs: nitrofurantoin, dapsone,
    sulfonamides, rasburicase, primaquine

Management

- MAHA

<!-- -->

- DIC: sepsis, malignancy, pregnancy

    - Treat underlying cause

    - If active bleeding: FFP, cryoprecipitate (to keep
        fibrinogen\>100) and platelets

- TTP: Order ADAMTS13 (prior to plasma transfusion or exchange)

    - If concern for TTP you should immediately consult Heme and
        Nephrology

- HUS: + shiga toxin, AKI, diarrhea

<!-- -->

- AIHA:

<!-- -->

- Cold (rare): IgM binds at temp \<37

    - Caused by lymphoproliferative disorder (Waldenström
        Macroglobulinemia), mycoplasma, EBV, HIV

    - Consult heme. Treat underlying. Consider rituximab (steroids
        ineffective)

- Warm: IgG

    - Idiopathic or associated with lymphoma, SLE, drugs, babesiosis,
        HIV

    - Can use steroids, IVIG, rituximab

RBC Size Framework

Normocytic Anemia: MCV 80-100

- Etiologies:

<!-- -->

- Anemia of inflammation: (may also be microcytic)

- Anemia of CKD: low Erythropoietin (EPO) levels

- Endocrine disease (hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency):
    ↓metabolic demand/O2 requirement

- Mixed macrocytic/microcytic disease may have a normal MCV: look for
    ↑RDW

- Pure red cell aplasia: associated with destructive Ab (CLL, thymoma,
    parvovirus, autoimmune)

- Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)

- Splenic sequestration

- Bone marrow failure or infiltration (typically will see
    pancytopenia)

<!-- -->

- Bone marrow biopsy may be indicated if no identifiable cause or
    anemia is associated with other cytopenia’s

Management

- If ANC \<500

<!-- -->

- Check all lines/IVs for erythema and induration daily

- Check mouth for mucositis, mouth care after meals and before bed

- Assess for Neutropenic Fever & Complications – see below

- Evaluate for indications for prophylaxis – see below

- No evidence to support use of neutropenic diet

- No digital rectal exams or enemas/suppositories (risk of bacterial
    translocation)

Neutropenic Fever

- ANC \<500 and T\> 100.4 °F or 38.0 °C

- Neutropenic pts are unable to mount an adequate immune response and
    can become critically ill very quickly

- Do not wait for a temp re-check, you need to start antibiotics
    immediately

Evaluation

- Chest X-ray

- Two sets of blood cultures (one from PICC/port if present)

- Urinalysis AND urine culture (not the reflex order set)

- If diarrhea, get C. diff PCR

- If abdominal pain, get CT A/P with IV contrast

Management

- Empirically treat with Cefepime

- Indications for Vancomycin:

<!-- -->

- Hemodynamically unstable

- Severe mucositis

- Focal consolidation on CXR

- Erythema/induration around line

- Concern for skin/soft tissue infection

- GPCs in blood

- Fever continues \>24h on cefepime

<!-- -->

- Additional Coverage:

<!-- -->

- If abdominal pain/diarrhea: Flagyl 500mg q8h

- Concern for C-diff: PO Vancomycin 125mg q6h

- Still fevering on Cefepime at 72 hrs (differs by attending)
    Meropenem

<!-- -->

- Fungal coverage: Consider if risk factors (TPN) or persistent fevers
    (\>72hrs)

    - Micafungin 100 mg IV daily or Voriconazole 200mg PO BID

Neutropenic Complications

Mucositis

- Can range from mouth soreness to severe erosions preventing
    eating/drinking

- Can become secondarily infected with Candida, HSV

<!-- -->

- Management:

    - Routine oral care with a soft toothbrush to remove plaque

    - Oral rinses with saline and/or sodium bicarbonate

    - Magic mouthwash for symptomatic relief (or viscous lidocaine at
        the VA)

    - Typically recovers quickly when ANC \> 500

Neutropenic enterocolitis (Typhlitis)

- Life-threatening bacterial translocation due to breakdown of
    gut-mucosal barrier

- Presentation: Abdominal pain + fever

<!-- -->

- +/- abdominal distension, nausea, vomiting, watery and/or bloody
    diarrhea

<!-- -->

- Diagnosis: CT A/P with contrast, consider C. diff PCR if diarrhea

- Treatment:

<!-- -->

- Cefepime/Flagyl OR Zosyn

- If no perforation/abscess on CT scan, typically continue until 14
    days after ANC recovers \>500 and abdominal pain resolves

- Can change to cipro/flagyl once ANC \>500

- If perforation/abscess: will need imaging to confirm resolution, and
    longer duration of abx

Neutropenic Prophylaxis

- Used if ANC is expected to be \< 500 for \> 7 days

Filgrastim (G-CSF – Neupogen/Zarxio /Granix)

- Induces bone marrow production of neutrophils

- Dose: either 300mcg or 480mcg (rounded from 5 mcg/kg/day)

- Common side effects: fatigue, nausea

- PEG-filgrastim (Neulasta): long-acting version that is only given as
    an outpatient

Thrombocytopenia – Robert Dunn

Background

- Platelet count \<150k (mild), 50-100k (moderate), \<50k (severe)

- Framework for differential: consumption, sequestration, destruction,
    production

- Causes to consider:

<!-- -->

- Can’t Miss Diagnoses: TTP, HUS, HELLP, DIC, HIT

- Platelet clumping (lab artifact - pseudothrombocytopenia)

- Splenomegaly can represent: Plt sequestration, cirrhosis, portal
    hypertension

- Drug-induced: (Antibiotics, heparin, chemo, GpIIb/IIIa antagonists,
    H2-antagonists)

- Rheumatologic cause – SLE, sarcoidosis, scleroderma renal crisis

- Sepsis, independent of DIC

- Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a diagnosis of exclusion

- Massive physiologic consumption: large hematoma, active hemorrhage

- Cirrhosis – results in low thrombopoietin (TPO) and increased
    clearance

- Chronic alcohol use – direct marrow suppression

- Infections: HIV, HCV, EBV, Parvovirus, Rickettsia, H. pylori, CMV

- Bone marrow failure: aplastic anemia, MDS, leukemia, chemotherapy

- Dilutional: fluid resuscitation and massive transfusion

Presentation

- Petechiae – typically begins distally on lower legs (in mouth = wet
    purpura), seen when \<10-20k

- Overt bleeding, mucosal bleeding, epistaxis (seen when \<20k)

Evaluation

- CMP, CBC w/diff, peripheral smear, citrated platelet count, immature
    platelet fraction (IPF)

- LDH, Fibrinogen, d-dimer, PT/aPTT

- Determine timing of decline as well as prior values

<!-- -->

- Look at other cell lines - never normal to have two cytopenia’s

- Review recent initiation of drugs: (heparin, antibiotics, and
    chemotherapy)

<!-- -->

- Consider abdominal ultrasound to look for splenomegaly and liver
    pathology

- Infectious work up (HIV, HCV)

- Calculate 4T Score and consider your pretest probability for HIT
    testing

<!-- -->

- HIT Ab: ELISA is first test – only run once/day at VUMC so order
    early if considering

- Reflex Serotonin release assay (SRA) for confirmation (VUMC performs
    reflexive testing)

Management

- Plt \<50k

<!-- -->

- Discontinue pharmacologic DVT prophylaxis (unless HIT)

- If on anticoagulation: consider risk/benefits of continued
    anticoagulation

    - Can transfuse plt’s if AC is mandatory

<!-- -->

- Plt \<10k

<!-- -->

- Transfuse platelets given risk of spontaneous intracranial
    hemorrhage

- In pt’s with HIT or TTP, there is theoretical concern that
    transfusing plt can “fuel the fire” and lead to more thrombosis, but
    if there is active bleeding then consider platelets

    - Therefore, bleeding with HIT or TTP, discuss with Hematology
        before transfusion

<!-- -->

- HIT

<!-- -->

- If pretest probability is high or HIT is confirmed

- Stop Unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin products

- Start Argatroban gtt

<!-- -->

- If schistocytes present on peripheral smear = concern for TTP

<!-- -->

- Draw ADAMTS13

- Contact Nephrology and Hematology for PLEX

Additional Information

- Clumping on lab draws:

<!-- -->

- Obtain Citrated platelet (“blue top” tube – CPRS refers to it as a
    blue top platelet count)

<!-- -->

- If no resolution, obtain a "Gold top" LAB 301 in Epic (Named: Plt
    count) (ACD tube)

Pancytopenia – Thomas Gracie

Background

- Framework for differential:

<!-- -->

- Impaired production (aplastic anemia, marrow infiltration, marrow
    suppression, vitamin/nutritional deficiencies, sepsis, cirrhosis)

- Peripheral destruction (autoimmune hemolytic, hypersplenism)

- Combined process (PNH, SLE, leukemia, HLH, infections)

Evaluation

- Medications: NSAIDs, AEDs, steroids, chemotherapy, antivirals,
    immunosuppression

- PMHx: autoimmune disease (SLE, RA), radiation, gastric surgery,
    malabsorption, liver disease, hematologic malignancy

- Social Hx: EtOH use, malnutrition, occupational exposures, exposures
    to TB or leishmaniasis

- Exam: lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, neuropathy, petechiae,
    stigmata of liver disease, cachexia

- Diagnostic studies: CBC w/ diff, CMP, reticulocyte count, peripheral
    smear, viral studies (hepatitis A/B/C, EBV, CMV, HIV, parvovirus
    B19), vitamin levels (B12, folate, copper, zinc), iron studies,
    hemolysis labs (LDH, haptoglobin, Coombs), flow cytometry, bone
    marrow biopsy, cytogenetics and FISH

Management

- For pancytopenia that is acute (hospital onset) often observation is
    the best approach

- When pancytopenia is slow, progressive over time, or acute without
    any other precipitating factors then would consult hematology for
    consideration of a bone marrow syndromes

Leukocytosis – Kenna Koehler

Background

- Common progenitor cells (stem cells) are located in the bone marrow
    and give rise to erythrocytes, myeloblasts, megakaryoblasts

- Normal WBC can vary by age and pregnancy, for the purpose of this
    section will assume this is for an average, non-pregnant adult

- Chronic mild neutrophilic leukocytosis (10-20k) is common with
    tobacco use and obesity, both due to mechanisms related to chronic
    inflammation

- Reactive (typically 11k-30k) - surgery, exercise, trauma, burns,
    emotional stress

- Leukemoid reaction (typically 50k-100k) - severe infections
    (fulminant *C difficile*), organ rejection

- If greater than 100k, think leukemia or myeloproliferative disorder

Evaluation

- Neutrophilia (neutrophil count \>7k)

<!-- -->

- Bacterial infection, pregnancy, rheumatologic disease, steroids,
    beta agonists, lithium, colony-stimulating factors, splenectomy or
    functional asplenia, congenital (hereditary/chronic idiopathic
    neutrophilia), Down syndrome, leukocyte adhesion deficiency,
    malignancy, smoking, obesity

<!-- -->

- Lymphocytosis (\>40% of WBC count or \>4,500k/mm<sup>3</sup>)

<!-- -->

- Infections (pertussis, syphilis, CMV, EBV, hepatitis A/B/C, toxo),
    hypersensitivity reactions, thyrotoxicosis, Addison's disease,
    hematologic malignancies, “reactive”

<!-- -->

- Monocytosis (\>8% of WBC count or \>880/mm<sup>3</sup>)

<!-- -->

- Infections (TB, fungal disease, protozoa, tick-borne), autoimmune
    disease, malignancy (CMML)

<!-- -->

- Eosinophilia (\>500/mm<sup>3</sup>)

<!-- -->

- Hypersensitivity (asthma, urticaria, atopic dermatitis, eosinophilic
    esophagitis), drug reactions, malignancies, connective tissue
    disease, idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome, infections
    (helminths, Scarlet fever, Hansen's disease), sarcoidosis, SLE

- Hypereosinophilia if AEC\>1500, typically merits heme evaluation

- Hypereosinophilic syndrome: AEC\>1500 and organ dysfunction from
    eosinophils

<!-- -->

- Basophilia (\>100/mm<sup>3</sup>)

<!-- -->

- CML, thyroid disease, IBC, chronic dermatitis, infections
    (varicella)

Venous Thromboembolism – Kenna Koehler

Background

- Includes both deep vein thrombosis (DVTs) and pulmonary embolism
    (PE). See “Pulmonary Embolism” section in cardiology for more
    information on PEs

- Risk Factors for Provoked DVT/PE

<!-- -->

- Major risk factors: major surgery \>30 minutes, hospitalization \> 3
    days, C-section

- Minor Risk Factors: Surgery \<30 minutes, Hospitalization \<3 days,
    pregnancy, estrogen therapy, reduced mobility \>3 days

<!-- -->

- Non-transient risk factors: Malignancy (active), IBD, liver disease,
    hereditary thrombophilia

Evaluation

- Asymmetric calf swelling of \>2cm sensitivity and specificity for
    DVT of 60-70%

- Wells’ Criteria for DVT can help guide diagnostic testing

<!-- -->

- If a patient has a low pre-test probability, a negative D-dimer can
    rule out DVT

- In a high pre-test probability patient a negative D-dimer is less
    helpful

<!-- -->

- Whole-leg ultrasounds with doppler

Management

- Prophylaxis: Padua score

<!-- -->

- Score \> 4 high risk, recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis

    - Subcutaneous Low Molecular Weight Heparin (LMWH) or Subcutaneous
        Heparin

- Score \<4 is low risk; recommend ambulation and SCDs

<!-- -->

- Treatment (see anticoagulation section)

<!-- -->

- Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)

- Oral factor Xa inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban)

- Intravenous unfractionated heparin

- Warfarin (with bridge therapy)

<!-- -->

- Duration of treatment

<!-- -->

- Provoked: 3 months or until provoking factor (trauma, surgery,
    malignancy) is removed

- Unprovoked: Typically requires life-long anticoagulation along with
    assistance from hematology

<!-- -->

- Anticoagulation in malignancy:

<!-- -->

- LMWH or DOAC (most evidence for apixaban and rivaroxaban) while
    malignancy still active

- Avoid rivaroxaban and edoxaban in GI malignancies (increased rates
    of bleeding)

Additional Information

- Should we get a follow up ultrasound?

<!-- -->

- A follow up ultrasound at the CONCLUSION of anticoagulation can help
    establish a post-treatment baseline and provide a baseline study for
    future comparison that can be critical for the diagnosis of
    recurrent/new DVT (which is very difficult to determine
    radiographically without a comparison imaging study)

<!-- -->

- What about IVC filters?

<!-- -->

- Select circumstances for these: In patients with acute DVT or PE and
    in whom anti-coagulation is absolutely contraindicated
    (thrombocytopenia, recent intra-cranial bleed, recent GI bleed)
    placement of a retrievable IVC filter should be discussed with
    Hematology and IR

Additional Information

- VA is starting to move towards rivaroxaban and apixaban for extended
    secondary thromboprophylaxis

<!-- -->

- Write in your PADR for apixaban citing “patient uses a pillbox and
    cannot use dabigatran”

<!-- -->

- Renal dysfunction: favor warfarin, apixaban or edoxaban

- Hx of GI bleed: avoid dabigatran, rivaroxaban, edoxaban (may have
    higher risk of GI bleed)

- Pregnancy: UFH/LMWH (other agents may cross the placenta)

Transitioning Between Anticoagulants with DOACs

- LMWH to Warfarin

<!-- -->

- Warfarin and LMWH given simultaneously until INR is therapeutic for
    24 hours

<!-- -->

- Warfarin to DOAC

<!-- -->

- Start DOAC when INR \< 2.0

<!-- -->

- DOAC to Warfarin

<!-- -->

- High Risk DVT/PE – start LMWH or UFH, then start Warfarin

- Low to Moderate Risk DVT/PE – Start warfarin while patient on DOAC,
    Stop DOAC on Day 3 of warfarin therapy, Check INR on day 4

<!-- -->

- LMWH to DOAC

<!-- -->

- Stop LMWH and start DOAC when due for next dose of LMWH (within 2
    hrs)

<!-- -->

- DOAC to LMWH

<!-- -->

- Stop DOAC and start LMWH when due for next DOAC dose

<!-- -->

- UFH to DOAC

<!-- -->

- Start DOAC when IV stopped (30 min prior to cessation if high risk
    for thrombosis)

- DOAC to UFH

- Start IV heparin with bolus when next DOAC dose is due

Peri-Procedural Management of Anticoagulation

- Temporary IVC filter indicated in pts with very recent acute VTE
    (within 3-4 weeks) if the procedure requires AC delay \>12 hours

- For those at high risk of thromboembolism:

<!-- -->

- Consider continuing AC for low-bleeding-risk procedures, i.e. dental
    procedures, cutaneous biopsy/excision, ICD placement, endovascular
    procedures.

- Can bridge with LMWH or heparin drip

Strategies for Reversal of Anticoagulation

Warfarin

- Vitamin K: onset within a few hours but takes 24-48 hrs for full
    effect

<!-- -->

- Life Threatening Bleeding: Give IV Vitamin K 10 mg over 30 minutes

- Intracranial bleed, bleed with hemodynamic instability, emergent
    procedure non-life threatening

    - INR \<5: Vitamin K not recommended

    - INR 5-10: Vitamin K 1-5 mg IV or PO

    - INR \>10: Vitamin K 5mg PO or 5 mg IV

- Prior to surgery

    - Rapid reversal INR \> 5: 5mg Vit K IV (24 hours prior to
        procedure)

<!-- -->

- FFP

<!-- -->

- 15 ml/kg (i.e. 4 units/70 kg person) if need reversal \<24 hrs, plus
    give Vitamin K

<!-- -->

- KCentra ($$$): Contains Factors II, VII, IX, and X with Protein C,
    Protein S, and heparin

<!-- -->

- Given instead of plasma when insufficient time for plasma/Vit K to
    work (i.e. for life threatening hemorrhage)

- Avoid giving this in HIT

- Administer with Vitamin K

Dabigatran

- Idarucizumab ($$$) will reverse if prolonged thrombin time (remember
    to check!) – Consult Hematology

Factor Xa Inhibitors (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban)

- FEIBA (Factor VIII inhibitor bypassing activity) – can promote
    coagulation but is <u>not a reversal agent</u>; limited data to
    support use

- Consult Hematology before using; andexanet alfa (FDA approved) is
    not on VUMC formulary but is on the VA formulary

Hypercoagulable States – Chris Cann

Background

- Virchow’s triad: 1. Hypercoagulability 2. Stasis 3. Endothelial
    injury

- Diagnostic thrombophilia testing indications:

<!-- -->

- Idiopathic or recurrent VTE

- First VTE at \<40 years old

- VTE in the setting of strong family history

- VTE in unusual vascular site (cerebral, renal, mesenteric)

- Recurrent pregnancy loss

<!-- -->

- Must consider if thrombophilia testing will change clinical
    management

<!-- -->

- If the unprovoked VTE warrants indefinite anticoagulation then
    testing may not be helpful

- However, if VTE provoked by minor risk factor (OCPs) with an
    underlying thrombophilia might change the decision, then testing may
    be informative

<!-- -->

- Separated into Acquired and Hereditary conditions:

<!-- -->

- Hereditary: Factor V Leiden mutation, Prothrombin mutation, Protein
    C or S deficiency, Antithrombin deficiency

- Acquired:

    - Antiphospholipid Syndrome (APLS)

    - Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)

    - Major surgery/trauma

    - Nephrotic Syndrome

    - Smoking

    - Pregnancy

    - Oral Contraceptives

    - Immobilization (bedridden, hip/knee replacement)

    - Active malignancy

    - Estrogen replacement therapy

    - Note: Travel (plane, train, automobile) is NOT on this list and
        this is NOT considered a provoking risk factor

<!-- -->

- Testing: all specific testing for hereditary disorders and APS
    should be performed at least 4-6 weeks after an acute thrombotic
    event or discontinuation of anticoagulant/thrombolytic therapies to
    avoid interference

Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APLS)

Background

- Most common acquired disorder (anti-phospholipid antibodies present
    in 3-5% population)

- Recurrent pregnancy loss, provoked DVT in young, unprovoked VTE and
    arterial thrombosis in young, thrombosis unusual sites, thrombosis
    in autoimmune disease

- This is a clinicopathologic diagnosis (need both clinical and
    laboratory criteria)

Evaluation

- Positive for at least 1 lab criterion on at least 2 occasions, at
    least 12 weeks apart:

<!-- -->

- Lupus anticoagulant: can occur in relation to drugs or infection;
    transient are associated with thrombotic risk

- Anticardiolipin antibodies

- B2GP1 (anti-beta2-glycoprotein) antibodies

<!-- -->

- Must also meet at least 1 of the following clinical criteria:

<!-- -->

- Vascular thrombosis: DVT, arterial thrombosis, or small vessel
    thrombosis of any organ

- Pregnancy loss: there are specific criteria for this – consult
    UpToDate or other resource

Management

- Aspirin for primary prevention; warfarin for treatment (INR 2-3)

- Do NOT use DOACs for triple positive APLS (see TRAPS trial:
    rivaroxaban inferior to warfarin)

- Rituximab for recurrent thrombosis despite anticoagulation
    (controversial) – call hematology

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT)

Type 1: Mild and self-limited (not immune-mediated)

- Occurs within the first 2 days of first-time exposure

- Platelet count normalizes with continued heparin therapy

Type 2 (what we typically refer to as HIT): Immune mediated

- Fall in plt 30% to over 50% (even if plt count \>150) and/or
    thrombotic event has occurred

<!-- -->

- 4-10 days after new exposure to heparin derivative OR≤

- 1 day after restarting heparin derivative that had been used 30-100
    days prior

    - If exposed to heparin within 100 days, will have platelet drop
        within 24 hr

<!-- -->

- Frequency: unfractionated heparin \> LMWH; Surgical wards \> medical
    wards

- 50% will have thrombotic event in 30 days if HIT is untreated, with
    20% mortality

- Arterial thrombi are common in HIT

- HIT results from antibodies to complexes of platelet factor 4 (PF4)
    and heparin, further activating platelets (the activated platelets
    aggregate causing thrombocytopenia)

Evaluation

- 4T score (0-8 points):

<!-- -->

- Thrombocytopenia (0-2 pts): degree and nadir of platelet count drop

- Timing (0-2 pts): timing of fall after initial or recurrent heparin
    exposure

- Thrombosis (0-2 pts): thrombosis, skin necrosis, non-necrotizing
    lesions, acute systemic reaction to heparin

- Other causes of thrombocytopenia (0-2 pts): more points if no
    alternate cause

<!-- -->

- Solid-phase ELISA for heparin-PF4 antibodies:

<!-- -->

- 0.2-0.4 is indeterminate

- \> 0.4 is positive

- \> 1.4 HIT is likely

- \> 2 confirms HIT

- The lab at VUMC will perform functional SRA reflexively for all
    values \>0.2

Management

- 0-3 points: Low concern for HIT; can restart heparin

- 4-5 points: Intermediate probability (\~10%) - hold heparin, start
    non-heparin anticoagulant

- 6 points: High probability (\~50%) - hold heparin, start non-heparin
    anticoagulant

- Argatroban (direct thrombin inhibitor) for prophylaxis and treatment
    of thrombosis

<!-- -->

- Avoid platelet transfusions as can increase thrombogenic effect

- Avoid warfarin until complete platelet recovery as may cause
    microthrombosis

<!-- -->

- Hematology consult for all confirmed HIT

Factor V Leiden mutation

Evaluation

- Activated protein C resistance assay

<!-- -->

- APC ratio in patient vs normal

- normal \>2.0, heterozygotes 1.5-2.0, homozygotes \<1.5

<!-- -->

- FVL mutation is then determined via PCR

- Screen with APC assay rather than PCR initially; cost effective

Management

- VTE treatment same as general population

<!-- -->

- VTE 4-8x risk in heterozygotes; 80x risk in homozygotes

<!-- -->

- Avoid OCPs: increased risk for VTE

Prothrombin gene mutation

Evaluation:

- PCR of G20210A mutation (2-4% prevalence)

Management:

- VTE treatment same as general population & avoid OCPs

Protein C & S Deficiency

Background

- Autosomal dominant; first event occurs between 10-50 years of age

- Synthesized in liver and Vit K dependent, therefore low levels in
    hepatic dysfunction and warfarin use/vitamin K deficiency

- Protein C: low in settings of thrombosis, DIC, nephrotic syndrome,
    intra/post-op

- Protein S: low in infectious (HIV) and autoimmune processes (IBD)

- Protein S decreases during pregnancy (decreased free Protein S,
    normal total Protein S)

<!-- -->

- Do not misdiagnose a pregnant patient with PS deficiency

Evaluation

- Functional Protein C & S assays

Management

- VTE treatment same as general population

- Avoid OCPs

- High risk patients may require protein C concentrate prior to
    surgery

- Increased risk of warfarin-induced skin necrosis

Antithrombin deficiency

Background

- Autosomal dominant, does not skip generations

- VTE in unusual sites (cerebral sinuses, renal veins)

- Present \< 50 y/o, but rarely in first two decades

- Decreased in liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, protein losing
    enteropathy, burn, trauma, bypass surgery, metastatic tumors,
    premenopausal, OCP use, pregnancy

Evaluation

- Functional antithrombin activity (AT-heparin cofactor assay)

- Then perform antigen quantity testing

Management

- Can use Argatroban as does not require antithrombin function

- Warfarin preferred in VTE (titrate up based on expression of
    antithrombin deficiency)

Coagulopathies – Jason Jones

- Step one: determine if platelet vs coagulation disorder

- Platelet Disorders: Skin/mucous membrane bleeding; Petechiae; Often
    mild bleeding following surgery and tends to immediately follow
    surgery

- Coagulation defect: Bleeding deep in soft tissues (muscles/joints);
    hemarthroses, hematomas; tendency to have delayed bleeding after
    surgery that can be severe

- Coagulopathies can be divided into Hereditary vs Acquired causes

Hereditary

Hemophilia A (Factor VIII Deficiency) and Hemophilia B (Factor IX
Deficiency)

- Inherited in X-linked Recessive pattern

- Diagnosis: Isolated prolonged PTT with normalization upon mixing
    study

- Management: purified/recombinant Factor VIII or IX. Desmopressin for
    mild disease

- Consult benign hematology every time these patients are admitted

von Willebrand Disease (vWD)

- Can be hereditary (common) or acquired

- Abnormal quantity or function of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) needed
    for platelet function

- Type 1 (most common): Quantitative defect. Low quantity, normal
    function of vWF

- Type 2: Qualitative defect. Normal quantity, abnormal function of
    vWF.

- Type 3 (rare): Complete absence of vWF, phenotypically similar to
    hemophilia A

- Order in Epic: vW Profile = vWF Ag, Factor VIII Activity, Ristocetin
    Cofactor Activity

- Management: Desmopressin (DDAVP) can be useful as prophylaxis or
    treatment; most patients are treated with factor concentrate
    replacements

Acquired

Coagulation Factor Inhibitors

- Associated with autoimmune disease (paraneoplastic vs. autoantibody)

- Seen in hemophilia due to frequent treatments with recombinant
    factors (alloantibody)

- Diagnosis: Elevated PTT that does not normalize with mixing study

- Management: Immunosuppression with steroids; cyclophosphamide +/-
    rituximab

<!-- -->

- Consult Hematology always (rare disorder with major bleeding
    complications)

Vitamin K Deficiency

- Caused by malnutrition, liver disease, or iatrogenic with warfarin

- Diagnosis: elevated PT, if severe may have prolonged PTT as well

- Management: Replace vitamin K

Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) - Eric Singhi

Background

- Concurrent activation of the coagulation pathway and fibrinolytic
    pathway

<!-- -->

- Consumption of platelets, fibrin, and coagulation factors
    fibrinolysis end organ damage and hemolysis

<!-- -->

- Etiologies:

<!-- -->

- Infection/Sepsis, Liver disease, Pancreatitis, Trauma

- Malignancies: mucin-secreting pancreatic/gastric adenocarcinoma,
    brain tumors, prostate cancer, all acute leukemias, acute
    promyelocytic leukemia

- Obstetric complications (i.e. preeclampsia/eclampsia, placental
    abruption)

- Acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (i.e. ABO incompatible
    transfusion)

Evaluation

- Exam: petechiae, bleeding (mucosal, IV site, surgical wound site,
    hematuria), ecchymoses, thrombosis (i.e. cold, pulseless
    extremities)

- CBC, PT/INR, aPTT, Fibrinogen, D-Dimer, Peripheral Blood Smear

- “DIC labs” = q6h fibrinogen, PT/INR, aPTT (space out when lower
    risk)

- Findings suggestive of DIC: thrombocytopenia, prolonged aPTT and
    PT/INR, hypofibrinogenemia, elevated D-dimer, fibrin degradation
    products, schistocytes

Management

- Treat the underlying cause!

- Vitamin K for INR \> 1.7 or bleeding

- Hypofibrinogenemia treatment: Cryoprecipitate 5-10 units if
    fibrinogen \< 100

- Thrombocytopenia treatment: plt transfusion as normally indicated

- DVT ppx if not bleeding and plt \> 50

- VTE: anticoagulation if plt \> 50 and no massive bleeding

Transfusion Medicine – R. Dixon Dorand

For emergent transfusions, call the blood bank (615-322-2233)

- RNs on 10T and 11N can follow transfusion protocols for pRBCs and
    Plts – enter as a Nursing Communication or as part of the
    Hematology/Oncology Admission Order set.

- At VUMC, all special processing of blood products (such as
    irradiation) will be decided by blood bank based on special
    considerations listed in order set. Examples include: stem cell
    transplant, hematologic malignancy, or thalassemia

- Patients with frequent transfusions (e.g. sickle cell
    hemoglobinopathy) should have an RBC Extended Phenotype ordered
    (once) for minor RBC antigens to avoid immunization and antibody
    development to these proteins

- You may ask the VUMC hematology lab to email you pictures of the
    peripheral smear

VA: Orders Tab – Blood Bank Orders – follow prompts to select
appropriate product. Must order both the blood product AND the
transfusion order (“Transfuse blood”)

- You need to specify all special processing such as irradiation

- To order a Type & Screen as a lab, you must go to Blood Bank Orders

- Type & Screen and Transfusion results are under the Blood tab in
    Results

Red Blood Cell Transfusion

- Volume 200-300 mL per unit prbc

- In general, 1 unit of packed RBCs increases Hgb by 1g/dL and HCT by
    \~3%

- Assessment of the post-transfusion Hgb can be performed 15 min
    following transfusion, but ideally 1 hour after completion

Indications:

- Hgb \<9-10 g/dL – Acute coronary syndrome

- Hgb \<8 g/dL or Hct \<25 – Bone marrow failure or receiving
    antineoplastic therapy

<!-- -->

- Also sometimes used in pts with pre-existing CAD

<!-- -->

- Hgb \<7 g/dL or Hct \<21 – ICU, GI Bleeding, Oncology patient on
    Treatment

Indications for Platelets

- \<11 k/µL – all patients, reduce risk of spontaneous hemorrhage (use
    on BMT, Brittingham)

- \<50 k/µL – active bleeding, scheduled to undergo select invasive
    procedure

- \<100 k/µL – CNS hemorrhage, intrathecal catheter

<!-- -->

- This is also the threshold used for most Neurosurgical procedures

Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) & Cryoprecipitate (Cryo)

Cryoprecipitate

- FFP enriched for von Willebrand factor, factor VIII, factor XIII,
    and fibrinogen

FFP

- Once thawed, must be used in 24 hrs (due to decline in labile
    coagulation factors)

- Must be ABO compatible but not crossmatched or Rh typing

- Only administer FFP if INR ≥1.7 (FFP will not fix an INR \< 1.7)

Indications for transfusion

- Bleeding:

<!-- -->

- FFP If INR \>1.7

- Cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen \<100.

<!-- -->

- DIC:

<!-- -->

- Fibrinogen \<100: Transfuse 5 – 10 units cryoprecipitate and repeat
    fibrinogen. If bleeding, consider raising transfusion threshold of
    cryoprecipitate to fibrinogen \<150

- For elevated INR, consider FFP transfusion. Thresholds for doing
    this vary by attending

<!-- -->

- Cirrhosis:

<!-- -->

- General concept: PT/INR, aPTT are unreliable markers for bleeding.
    Fibrinogen ≤100 – 120 or thromboelastography are better surrogates
    for bleeding risk

- Transfuse fibrinogen ≤100 – 120 if the patient is actively bleeding
    or about to undergo a procedure or surgery other than paracentesis

- Transfuse FFP based on hepatology team preference (generally few
    indications for FFP)

Transfusion Premedication & Reactions

- If you are concerned about a serious transfusion reaction, pause the
    transfusion and contact the blood bank asap

- Order the transfusion reaction blood testing in Epic. You will send
    a CBC, the bag of blood products, and the completed form to the
    blood bank for analysis

Premedication:

- Only if history of severe reaction

<!-- -->

- Diphenhydramine 25-50mg IV

- Acetaminophen 650 mg PO

- Meperidine 25-50 mg IV (optional for chills)

- Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV (optional, for severe reactions or reactions
    despite acetaminophen and diphenhydramine)

Sickle Cell Crisis – Michael J. Neuss

Background

- Present with severe pain in bone, joints, chest, abdomen

- Causes: (HIDISC) Hypoxia, Ischemia, Dehydration, Infection, Stress,
    Cold

- Can’t Miss:

<!-- -->

- Acute chest: hypoxia + fever + chest pain + new infiltrate on CXR
    (consult benign hematology immediately, do not wait until the next
    day)

- PE (ACS less likely in these patients); avascular necrosis of hip,
    priapism, stroke

Evaluation

- Labs: LDH (high), Hgb/Hct (low; check vs baseline), retic, smear,
    WBC

- If febrile: UA + Blood cultures

- Send Hgb S level, and compare to baseline w/ other hospital
    admissions

- Imaging: CXR, MRI for hip pain, Abdominal U/S or CT abdomen

- Maintain active type and cross given probability of antibodies

Management

- General:

<!-- -->

- Look for a care coordination yellow note in the Summary Tab

    - Heme clinic will have specific management preferences for
        individual patients

- Maintain hydration, IVF at 150-200 cc/hr (if no contraindication)

- Oxygen: goal sat \~95% (higher O2 goal will help to prevent further
    sickling!)

- Continue folic acid 1 mg qDay

- Continue hydroxyurea if uncomplicated pain crisis

    - Hold if counts suppressed or concern for infection

- If in the MICU: consider discussion for plasma exchange (if Hgb SS
    or SC or S-Thal)

- Transfuse: Simple transfusion if Hgb lower than baseline and/or
    complications

    - Avoid transfusions when able, given risk of antibody formation

<!-- -->

- Pain:

<!-- -->

- Will generally require opiates, likely initiation of PCA

- All SS patients should have pain plans; inpatient pain plans are in
    the problem list under sickle cell disease or in the care
    coordination section of Epic

- Outpatient plans (to which you will transition pts back prior to
    discharge) are not standardized in location, but can be under Media
    (with a pain contract) or found in notes

<!-- -->

- Acute chest:

<!-- -->

- Consult Hematology at time of admission

- D5 1/2 NS @ 150-250 cc/hr

- Transfuse hgb to \>10

- PCA w/ dilaudid

- Abx for CAP (vs HAP if risk factors) ± bronchodilators

<!-- -->

- Consider LP for NHL with high risk of CNS involvement or presence of
    neurological symptoms

<!-- -->

- Risk factors: Burkitt, Lymphoblastic, testicular involvement,
    double/triple hit

- Multiple LPs may be required to diagnose CNS lymphoma

<!-- -->

- Diagnosis requires tissue

<!-- -->

- Excisional Lymph node biopsy (Surg Onc Consult)

        > \<10.5, male, stage IV disease, age\>45, WBC count\> 15K,
        > lymphocyte \<8% of WBC count

- **Non-Hodgkin:**

    - **Good prognosis:** Follicular, Marginal Zone, Mycosis
        > Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome

    - **Poor prognosis:** DLBCL – can arise from low grade lymphoma
        > (Richter transformation), Double**/**Triple Hit: bcl-2, bcl-6,
        > or myc aberrations, Mantle Cell, Burkitt, Lymphoblastic
        > Lymphoma, and Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma

General Management:

- ECG and TTE to establish pre-chemotherapy cardiac function – many
    chemo regimens with anthracyclines

- Daily labs: CBC, TLS, LDH

- TLS prophylaxis: mIVF, allopurinol

Myelodysplastic Syndromes – Peter Hanna

Background

- MDS is a malignant clonal myeloid disorder resulting in ineffective
    (dysplastic) hematopoiesis leading to peripheral cytopenia’s and a
    risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML)

- Usually idiopathic, a disease of the elderly (median onset at age
    70)

- The WHO has several classification schemes for MDS

<!-- -->

- Most important for classification is the percent of blasts in the
    bone marrow

- Note \>20% blasts in marrow = AML. Thus MDS & AML are on a continuum

Presentation

- 50% asymptomatic; Symptoms can include nonspecific but gradual
    fatigue, weakness

- Dysplastic cells do not work properly infections and bleeding are
    more likely

- Macrocytic anemia is most common finding; followed by bicytopenia or
    pancytopenia

- Isolated neutropenia or thrombocytopenia are unusual but possible

- Ask about secondary causes:

<!-- -->

- Exposure to chemicals (benzene, crude oil/gasoline industry,
    cigarette smoke), chemotherapy, radiation

- Medications, alcohol use, chronic infections (HIV)

Evaluation

- Goal is to rule out reversible causes of dysplasia and cytopenias

- CBC w/differential, Peripheral Smear, B12, Folate, HIV

<!-- -->

- May consider Copper & Zinc (send out labs, are expensive and rare
    but check when MDS is being considered)

<!-- -->

- Dysplastic changes on peripheral smear: hypogranulated/hyposegmented
    neutrophils, hypogranulated platelets and macrocytosis of RBCs

<!-- -->

- Circulating myeloblasts can be seen

<!-- -->

- Final diagnosis made by Bone marrow Biopsy

Management

- Molecular characteristics define the “risk” of the disease and
    dictates treatments

- Prognostic scoring tools: revised international prognostic staging
    system (R-IPSS)

- Management general paradigm:

<!-- -->

- Asymptomatic: with low-risk disease = monitoring

- Low-risk disease + symptoms due to anemia only: transfusions,
    erythrocyte stimulating agents, and treatment with Luspatercept

- MDS with isolated del(5q): treated with lenalidomide

- High-risk patients: treated with hypomethylating agents

- Only curative intervention = hematopoietic stem cell transplant
    (HSCT)

Acute Leukemia – Robert Corty

Background

- Hematology malignant caused by unchecked proliferation of WBC
    precursors in the bone marrow

- Pt’s with suspected acute leukemia require hospitalization for
    urgent diagnosis & treatment

- Types:

<!-- -->

- AML = Acute Myeloid Leukemia

    - APL = Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia defined by translocation
        (15;17) PML-RARA

- ALL = Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia

<!-- -->

- Risk Factors:

<!-- -->

- radiation, chemical exposures (e.g benzene), chemotherapy (esp
    alkylating agents)

- HIV, immunosuppression, smoking

- myeloproliferative disorders, aplastic anemia

Presentation

- Leukocytosis, leukemia cutis, gingival hypertrophy, leukostasis

- Functional Leukopenia, often neutropenia: recurrent infections

- Anemia: fatigue, pallor, dyspnea

- Thrombocytopenia: gingival bleeding, epistaxis, petechiae,
    ecchymoses, menorrhagia

- Extramedullary hematopoiesis: splenomegaly, hepatomegaly,
    lymphadenopathy

Evaluation

- Diagnosis of acute leukemia requires one of the following:

<!-- -->

- 20% blasts in peripheral blood

- \> 20% blasts in bone marrow biopsy

- Any pathognomonic cytogenetic abnormality of t(8;21), inv(16),
    t(15;17)

<!-- -->

- Check for the presence of these time-sensitive conditions.

<!-- -->

- DIC – check fibrinogen, PT, PTT, platelets

- TLS – check uric acid, phosphate, K+

- Neutropenic fever – check temp, neutrophil count

- Leukostasis (see below)

- Presumptive APL – promyelocytes on diff, DIC or Auer rods on smear

<!-- -->

- Confirm if peripheral flow cytometry ordered/in process

- Use hematology admission order set

<!-- -->

- Set RBC and Plt transfusion thresholds

- Order nurse-driven electrolyte repletion

- ECG and TTE to establish pre-chemotherapy cardiac function

- Daily labs: CBC, TLS, DIC

- TLS prophylaxis

Management

- Consult hematology

<!-- -->

- Discuss chemo plan and order double lumen PICC for reliable access

- If findings suggest APL start ATRA

- Subspecialized lab tests: bone marrow biopsy, cytogenetics, FISH

<!-- -->

- Monitor for Common Complications/Emergencies: (see individual
    sections)

<!-- -->

- TLS, DIC, Febrile Neutropenia, Leukostasis

Additional Information

- Obtain blood product consent on admission

- APL Specific findings: promyelocytes on differential or Auer rods on
    smear

- Differentiation syndrome: promyelocytes differentiate

<!-- -->

- Symptoms and signs: fever, SOB, Hypotn, peripheral edema, pleural
    effusion, AKI

- Diagnosis: No defined criteria. If suspicious, discuss with
    hematology fellow

- Management: steroids. If critically ill, hold ATRA and ATO and
    consider hydroxyurea

Leukemia Treatment Overview

- General strategy is to use “induction” chemo to try to induce
    clinicopathologic (as opposed to molecular) “remission”

- Defined as absence of symptoms, normal CBC, and \< 5% blasts in bone
    marrow (on day 28)

- Then waiting in hospital until neutrophil count \> 500 (typically
    \~3 weeks)

- From there, bone marrow transplant (for high-risk disease) or
    “consolidation” chemo for normal-risk or low-risk disease

AML

- Induction

<!-- -->

- Typical is “7+3” i.e. idrarubicin on days 1-3 and cytarabine on days
    1-7

- If therapy-related AML, MDS-related AML, or AML with cytogenetics
    similar to MDS, use “Vyxeos” which is liposomal daunorubicin and
    cytarabine on days 1, 3, and 5

- If low-risk dz (t(8;21) or inv(16)), use cytarabine on days 1-7, and
    3 days of low-dose daunorubicin + gemtuzumab-ozogamicin

- There are other induction regimens that can be used depending on
    specific cytogenetics and patient frailty, which is beyond the scope
    of the handbook

<!-- -->

- Consolidation

<!-- -->

- Typically “HiDAC”(high-dose Ara-C i.e. cytarabine)

    - Generally too toxic for pts with age \> 60, so a dose reduction
        is used

- In the case of relapse, typical treatment is a different high-dose
    chemo and BMT if possible

ALL

- Typical induction is “HyperCVAD” (hyper-fractionated
    cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin (“A” due to trade name
    Adriamycin), and dexamethasone

- If t(9;22) (known as Philadelphia chromosome), use tyrosine kinase
    inhibitor (TKI)

- If CD20+, use rituximab

Plasma Cell Dyscrasias – Rahul Shah, Jennifer Marvin-Peek

Background

- A heterogenous group of benign, premalignant, and malignant
    conditions characterized by clonal proliferation of plasma cells

- Results in over-production of monoclonal immunoglobulins or
    polypeptides (i.e., M-protein) that can be detected in serum and/or
    urine

- Includes monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS),
    smoldering myeloma (SMM), multiple myeloma (MM), Waldenström
    Macroglobulinemia (WM), extra-medullary plasmacytoma, AL
    amyloidosis, POEMS syndrome

- Spectrum of MGUS, SMM, and MM represents natural progression of same
    disease process

- Complications: Increased infectious risk, cytopenias, renal failure,
    hyperviscosity syndrome, malignant hypercalcemia, pain crisis from
    bony disease

- Elevated gamma/protein gap (serum total protein minus albumin \>4)
    often prompts work-up for an underlying plasma cell dyscrasia (high
    specificity but low sensitivity)

Evaluation

- CBC w/ diff, peripheral blood smear, CMP (for Ca, Cr, albumin), LDH,
    CRP, urinalysis

- SPEP with immunofixation, UPEP (24-hour urine) with immunofixation,
    serum free light chains (FLC)

- Quantitative immunoglobulins (IgA, IgM, IgG, IgD, IgE)

- If Hgb \<10, Cr \>2, Ca \>11.5, M-protein \>1.5, non-IgG M-spike,
    abnormal FLC ratio:

<!-- -->

- Bone marrow biopsy + cytogenetics

- β2-microglobulin, serum viscosity (in WM)

- Skeletal imaging to identify bone lesions: skeletal survey (x-ray)
    often done initially, then more sensitive CT/PET-CT/MRI if biopsy
    shows SMM/MM

- If considering amyloidosis: abdominal wall fat pad biopsy with Congo
    red staining typically sufficient vs direct biopsy of
    amyloid-involved tissue

Multiple Myeloma

Evaluation

- Diagnosis requires clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥10% or
    bony/extramedullary plasmacytoma AND one or more end-organ event
    (CRAB criteria) or biomarker of myeloma

- CRAB criteria

    - Hypercalcemia, renal impairment, anemia, bone osteolytic lesions

<!-- -->

- Biomarkers of multiple myeloma

    - Clonal bone marrow plasma cells ≥ 60%

    - Serum FLC ratio ≥ 100 or ≤ 0.01

    - \>1 focal lesion ≥ 5mm on MRI

- Skeletal imaging: Whole-body PET-CT or CT preferred, MRI, bone
    survey (x-ray)

Management

- First-line induction therapy typically is RVd: immunomodulatory
    agent (lenalidomide \[<u>R</u>evlimid\]), proteasome inhibitor
    (bortezomib \[<u>V</u>elcade\]) and <u>d</u>examethasone

- Consolidation therapy includes autologous SCT for transplant
    eligible patients

- Maintenance therapy is often given indefinitely, typically
    lenalidomide or bortezomib

- Relapsed disease is often treated with anti-CD38 monoclonal Ab
    (daratumumab) with a steroid and either immunomodulatory drug or
    proteosome inhibitor; CAR-T also recently approved for relapsed MM

- Supportive Care

<!-- -->

- VTE prophylaxis with DOAC or LMWH if on an immunomodulatory agent
    > with 2 VTE risk factors; if only 0-1 VTE risk factors aspirin

<!-- -->

- EPO and G-CSF for treatment-related anemia and neutropenia

- Bisphosphonate (ideally zoledronic acid) to reduce risk of
    > fractures; analgesia ± radiotherapy for bone pain and palliation

- (Val)acyclovir if on bortezomib for VZV prophylaxis

Lymphoplasmacytic Lymphoma/Waldenström Macroglobulinemia (IgM)

Presentation

- Hyperviscosity syndrome: blurred vision, dizziness, diplopia,
    hypoxia, ataxia, vertigo, stroke, coma

- Peripheral neuropathy

- Retinal changes: dilated veins, hemorrhages, papilledema

- Cryoglobulinemia: large IgM complexes precipitate out in the cold,
    causing Raynaud's, urticaria, purpura, acral cyanosis, tissue
    necrosis

Evaluation

- Requires: IgM monoclonal gammopathy on SPEP, BM biopsy w/≥10%
    lymphocytes with plasmacytoid differentiation (late stage B-cell
    differentiation), and MYD88 mutation detected

    \<4000 (Rituximab can temporarily ↑ IgM and ↑ risk of hyperviscosity
    syndrome)

- Monitor response with: IgM levels, monoclonal IgM on SPEP

Other Plasma Cell Dyscrasias

- Extracellular deposition of misfolded light chains (most commonly
    kidney & heart)

<!-- -->

- Features: nephrotic syndrome, restrictive CM, peripheral neuropathy,
    > HSM, macroglossia, easy bruising/bleeding,
    > dysautonomia/orthostasis

<!-- -->

- Diagnosis:

    - Need ALL 4: amyloid related systemic syndrome, positive congo
        > red staining on any tissue, evidence that amyloid is light
        > chain related, evidence of monoclonal plasma cell disorder

    accumulation, violaceous lymph node biopsy w/characteristic
    hematopathology papules

Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs) – Christina Snider

Background

- MPNs = chronic myeloid disorders caused by abnormal proliferation of
    mature bone marrow cell lineages (granulocytes, erythrocytes, or
    megakaryocytes)

- MPNs differ from myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS); cells in MPNs are
    normally developed (i.e. not dysplastic)

- Four “classic” MPNs: polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia,
    primary myelofibrosis and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)

Polycythemia Vera (PV)

Background

- Polycythemia is a general term: Men = Hb/Hct \> 16.5/49%; Women =
    Hb/Hct \> 16/48%

- Relative polycythemia = Concentrated H/H due to decreased plasma
    volume

<!-- -->

- Diuretic use, vomiting, diarrhea; H/H should normalize with fluid
    resuscitation

<!-- -->

- Absolute polycythemia = Increased RBC mass

<!-- -->

- Primary polycythemia: 2/2 Inherited/acquired mutation in RBC
    progenitor

- Secondary polycythemia: Increase in RBC mass due to elevated serum
    EPO

    - Hypoxia/cardiopulmonary associated (chronic pulmonary disease,
        R-to-L cardiac shunts, sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation
        syndrome, chronic carbon monoxide poisoning, including heavy
        smoking)

    - Kidney associated causes (following renal transplant, renal
        artery stenosis, hydronephrosis)

    - Autonomous EPO production from an EPO-producing tumors (rare)

    - Steroid Use

<!-- -->

- Epidemiology: Median age of diagnosis is 60 years; 25% cases present
    at age \<50 years.

- \>95% PV pts have JAK2 V617F mutation, but JAK2 V617F mutation is
    not specific to PV and can be seen in other MPNs

Presentation

- Incidentally elevated H/H

- Splenomegaly, generalized pruritus (post-warm bath/shower), unusual
    thrombosis

- Erythromelalgia: intermittent occurrence of red, hot, painful
    extremities

Evaluation

- CBC with differential and peripheral smear

- EPO level

- Rule out secondary causes: Sleep Study, Carboxyhemoglobin, steroids

- Peripheral blood screen for JAK2 V617F mutation

Management

- PV treatment aims to prevent thrombosis and bleeding events.

- Phlebotomy: maintain Hct \<45% (One unit 500 mL decreases Hct by 3%)

- ASA 81 mg for thrombosis prevention and symptom control

- Hydroxyurea: indicated for high-risk patients (\>60 years old or
    with history of thrombosis)

- Interferon-alfa, busulfan, or ruxolitinib: indicated in select
    high-risk patients

Essential thrombocythemia (ET)

Background

- Clonal stem cell disorder w/ increased platelet counts (\>450k/uL)

- Risks of thrombosis and hemorrhage

- Median age of diagnosis: 60 years; Twice as common in females.

Presentation

- Incidental thrombocytosis on CBC

- Splenomegaly, unusual thrombosis, and erythromelalgia

Evaluation

- Screen for conditions that cause reactive thrombocytosis: Chronic
    inflammatory diseases, infections, bleeding/hemolysis, iron
    deficiency, post splenectomy

- CBC with smear (platelet anisocytosis) ranging from very small to
    giant platelets

- CMP, LDH, Uric Acid, iron studies

- BCR ABL1 testing should be sent to exclude CML

- Bone marrow biopsy with staining, cytogenetics, and molecular
    testing for JAK2, CALR, MPL mutations

Management

- Avoid ASA 81 in patients with platelet counts \>1 million
    complicated by acquired von Willebrand syndrome due to increased
    risk of bleeding

Primary Myelofibrosis (PMF)

Background

- Clonal proliferation of myeloid cells with variable morphologic
    maturity resulting in reactive marrow fibrosis and extramedullary
    hematopoiesis

- Least favorable prognosis out of MPN

Presentation

- Fatigue, weight loss, low grade fever, bone pain, and night sweats

- Marked splenomegaly +/-hepatomegaly (due to extramedullary
    hematopoiesis)

Evaluation

- smear: teardrop shaped RBCs (dacrocytes)

- Bone marrow biopsy: “dry tap” due to extensive reticulin and/or
    collagen fibrosis mutually exclusive mutations in JAK2, MPL, or CALR

Management

- Low risk patients: Observe if asymptomatic

- Cure by allogenic HCT transplantation in young, high-risk patients

- Treatment of anemias include transfusion support

- Surgical splenectomy if abdominal pain or transfusion dependent
    anemia (used very infrequently)

Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)

Background

- Definition: MPN characterized by the overproduction of myeloid stem
    cells that can differentiate

- Chronic phase:

<!-- -->

- Fatigue, weight loss, bleeding

- Abdominal fullness and early satiety due to splenomegaly

- WBC on CBC is typically \>100k, and smear shows neutrophilic cells
    in all stages of maturation with \<2% blasts

<!-- -->

- Accelerated phase: Refractory leukocytosis, 10-19% blasts in
    peripheral blood or bone marrow, worsening peripheral basophilia,
    thrombocytopenia

- Blast phase = acute leukemia. \>20% blasts in peripheral blood or
    bone marrow, extramedullary proliferation of blasts

Evaluation

- Typical findings in blood and bone marrow and confirmation of
    Philadelphia chromosome (BCR-ABL1 fusion gene) via conventional
    cytogenetics, FISH, or rt-PCR

Management

- Hydroxyurea can be used to reduce WBC while awaiting confirmation

- Oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIS): Imatinib, dasatinib,
    nilotinib, and ponatinib

- Allogenic hematopoietic cell transplantation: Curative option for
    pts in accelerated and blast phase, as well as young pts w/chronic
    phase CML who do not respond to TKI therapy

Bone Marrow Transplant – Chelsie Sievers

Background

- Donor selection

<!-- -->

- Autologous: self, no matching required (no GVHD risk, but also no
    graft-vs-tumor effect)

- Allogeneic: non-self, matching based on HLA (more matched = less
    GVHD risk)

    - Matched-related donor (MRD): fully matched sibling

    - Matched-unrelated donor (MUD): From NMDP database

    - Haploidentical: Half matched sibling or parent

<!-- -->

- Source of stem cells:

<!-- -->

- Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs) vs bone marrow-derived cells vs
    umbilical cord

<!-- -->

- Conditioning regimens:

<!-- -->

- Myeloablative vs Reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC)

<!-- -->

- GVHD prophylaxis (for allo-SCT):

<!-- -->

- Regimen varies, can include tacrolimus, MMF, MTX, or thymo and
    alemtuzumab during conditioning

    Complications/Adverse Effects:

<!-- -->

- Infectious

<!-- -->

- Neutropenic fever, neutropenic enterocolitis (typhlitis)

- Bacterial infections

- Viral infections

    - CMV: check weekly PCR levels post-allo-SCT

        - All CMV+ recipients are treated with letermovir
            prophylactically regardless of donor status

    - EBV: check weekly PCR levels post allo-SCT. If EBV VL \>1000 on
        two occasions, can treat with pre-emptive rituximab to reduce
        the risk of PTLD

- Invasive fungal infections (e.g. aspergillus, candida)

<!-- -->

- Non-infectious

<!-- -->

- Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, mucositis, cytopenias

- Hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD)/sinusoidal obstructive syndrome

    - Symptoms: skin rash, cholestatic liver injury, diarrhea

    - Treatment: IV steroids (methylprednisolone 1-2mg/kg x 5d)

        - If refractory: mycophenolate, etanercept, ruxolitinib,
            antithymocyte globulin

- Chronic GVHD (typically after T+100)

    - Can involve all organs but typically see a scleroderma-like
        picture (xerophthalmia, xerostomia dysphagia, arthritis, skin
        changes, malar rash, obliterative bronchiolitis, cholestatic
        liver injury, cytopenias)

    - Treatment: steroids (also photophoresis for skin), consider
        trials of ruxolitinib, ibrutinib, rituximab if refractory

- PTLD (post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders)

    - Pathophysiology: B-cell proliferative disease typically 2/2
        > latent EBV

    - Symptoms: fever, weight loss, fatigue, lymphadenopathy,
        > extra-nodal masses, ↑ EBV PCR

CAR T-cell Therapy – Chelsie Sievers

Background

- Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) are a type of autologous
    T-cell therapy collected from the patient and genetically modified
    to contain an extracellular tumor-specific antigen target linked to
    the internal component of the T-cell receptor.

- Goal: patient's own T-cells can specifically target the tumor cell
    population.

- FDA approved therapies: Kymriah (CD19), Abecema (BCMA), Breyanzi
    (CD19), Tecartus (CD19), Yescarta (CD19)

Complications:

Oncologic Emergencies – Madeleine Turcotte

Leukostasis

Presentation

- Primarily occurs with acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic
    leukemia. This is not common with CLL or CML with high leukocyte
    counts in the absence of a significant increased portion of
    peripheral blasts

- Respiratory: dyspnea, hypoxia (note CXR may be normal)

<!-- -->

- PaO2 by ABG often falsely low from WBC consuming O2 in vitro. Trust
    SpO2.

<!-- -->

- CNS: headache, AMS, vision changes, dizziness, tinnitus, gait
    instability, neuro deficit

Evaluation

- CBC with diff and peripheral blood smear

- Imaging: CT head to evaluate neuro deficit and to check for ICH

- Chest X-Ray vs CT chest to evaluate dyspnea and air space
    abnormalities

Management

- Call hematology

- Emergent cytoreduction

<!-- -->

- Leukapheresis: page nephrology and place dialysis catheter

<!-- -->

- Hydroxyurea and chemotherapy per hematology fellow

- Transfer/admit to ICU

Tumor Lysis Syndrome – Bradley Christensen

Background

- Lysis of malignant cells either spontaneously or in response to
    chemotherapy causing release of K, Phos, nucleic acids, and
    cytokines

- Consequences:

<!-- -->

- Hyperkalemia: most urgent and immediately life threatening

- Hyperphosphatemia: binds Ca and leads to CaPhos crystal deposition
    AKI, HypoCa

- Hyperuricemia (from breakdown of DNA) precipitation in renal tubules
    AKI

- Hypotension, AKI from cytokine release

<!-- -->

- Laboratory TLS

<!-- -->

- Uric acid ≥ 8, Ca2+ ≤ 7, K+, or PO43- ≥ 4.5

- OR \> 25% change from baseline in these values

Evaluation

- Risk Stratification:

<!-- -->

- Highest risk after starting chemotherapy, but can occur
    spontaneously

<!-- -->

- Tumor characteristics which confer a higher risk of developing TLS:

<!-- -->

- High (\>5% risk): ALL (WBC\> 100K or LDH 2x ULN), AML (WBC\> 100K),
    Burkitt’s (III/IV or LDH≥2xULN, DLBCL with bulky disease,
    intermediate risk + AKI/CKD

- Intermediate: ALL (WBC\<100K, LDH \<2x ULN), AML (WBC 25-100K),
    Burkitt’s LDH\<2x ULN), DLBCL (non-bulky, LDH\>ULN), CLL (if tx with
    fludarabine, rituximab, lenalidomide, or venetoclax +LN 5-10 cm or
    ALC≥25K), plasma cell leukemia, rare chemo-sensitive solid tumors
    (small cell)

- Low: all others

Management

- Prevention:

<!-- -->

- High risk: q6-8h TLS labs, IVF (±loop diuretic if volume overload),
    allopurinol, ± rasburicase

- Intermediate – q8h TLS labs, IVF, allopurinol

- Low – daily TLS labs, IVF

    - Significant hydration: goal to maintain UOP 80-100 mL/hr

    - Allopurinol: 300 mg PO BID for CrCl \> 20 mL/min, UpToDate renal
        dosing if lower

    - Rasburicase ($$$): contraindicated in G6PD (send G6PD if not
        urgent and AA, Asian or Jewish descent)

        - Given if uric acid \> 8 mg/dL: get fellow approval before
            ordering

<!-- -->

- Treatment: (Can use as night/cross cover handoff)

<!-- -->

- K+ \> 5.5: STAT EKG. Kayexalate 30g orally or 60g per rectum (unless
    contraindicated) x1

    - Give 10 U insulin/1 amp D50

    - If EKG changes, then calcium gluconate and D5W at 100 mL/hr with
        repeat BG in 1 hr

- Uric acid \> 8 with 25% change from baseline: page hematology fellow
    to discuss rasburicase

- PO4 \> 4.5 with 25% change from baseline: start/↑ phos binder
    (sevelamer)

- Dialysis may be necessary in patients with poor renal function.

- IV calcium: do not administer unless symptomatic AND
    hyperphosphatemia is corrected

    - With high phos, IV calcium can lead to calcium deposition and
        renal failure

- Hemodialysis: pt with anuria, refractory hyperkalemia, and
    symptomatic hypocalcemia

Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Syndrome

Background

- Commonly Associated Malignancies: Lung Cancer, Non-Hodgkin or
    Hodgkin Lymphoma, Mediastinal Germ Cell Tumors, Thymic Malignancies

- Partial or complete obstruction of the SVC impedes blood return from
    the upper extremities, head, neck, and brain resulting in upstream
    congestion

- Can be 2/2 a mass in the mediastinum or thrombosis (foreign body
    i.e. catheter)

Presentation

- Facial or neck swelling without generalized edema

- Sense of head fullness, exacerbated by leaning forward or lying down

- Pulmonary symptoms including dyspnea, stridor, hoarseness, cough -
    due to edema narrowing the nasal passages and larynx or mechanical
    airway obstruction

- Physical Exam: facial and neck edema particularly of the eye lids in
    the morning, distended neck and chest veins; can also sometimes see
    upper extremity swelling, papilledema, plethora. Look for associated
    lymph node enlargement anywhere particularly including
    supraclavicular, cervical, and axillary region

Evaluation

- CXR: may show mass, perihilar or mediastinal disease

- Contrasted CT scan ± CT Venography: Phased to get a view of clot
    contribution to obstruction guides decision regarding
    anticoagulation or stenting

<!-- -->

- Radiology attending can coordinate with techs (requires verbal
    direct request)

<!-- -->

- MRI/MRV may provide additional information (often not possible due
    to pt too sick)

Management

- Assess airway and prepare for intubation if needed

- Keep head of bed elevated

- Thrombosis:

<!-- -->

- Removal of lines/catheters associated with thrombus

- Consideration of anticoagulation

<!-- -->

- Tumor compression: the type of tumor guides treatment (tissue biopsy
    is key)

- Stat/urgent consultations:

<!-- -->

- Interventional radiology for possible stenting/dilatation

- Radiation oncology- for radiation therapy

- Interventional pulmonology – for help with tissue dx

- Medical oncology – for help with diagnosis and chemotherapy

Spinal Cord Compression

Background

- Malignancies where cord compression is most common:

<!-- -->

- Multiple Myeloma, Lymphoma (both Hodgkin and NHL), Lung, Breast,
    Prostate Cancer

<!-- -->

- Tumor mass & compressed and often displaced bone impinges thecal sac
    or nerve roots spinal cord or any spinal nerves including the cauda
    equina

Presentation

- Back pain, motor, or sensory deficits

- Cauda Equina syndrome bowel or bladder incontinence, ataxia

Evaluation

- Neurologic exam with sensation testing seeking level below an
    identified dermatome

- Lab testing: If no known malignancy check CBC, CMP, SPEP, and (in
    males) PSA

- Bladder US if suspicion or retention with or without overflow
    incontinence

Management

- If suspected, order MRI without and with contrast; if patient unable
    to have MRI, CT myelography may be considered

- Immediate high dose steroids (dosing is controversial with
    recommendations ranging from 4 to 100 mg of dexamethasone q6h -
    choice of dexamethasone is to minimize mineralocorticoid effects.
    Most common dosing is 10mg IV x1 followed by 4mg IV q6h)

- Consider stat/urgent consultation with:

<!-- -->

- Neurosurgery for diagnostic/therapeutic intervention

- Radiation oncology- for radiation therapy

- Medical oncology – for help with diagnosis and chemotherapy

<!-- -->

- Ensure regular neuro-vascular checks and close monitoring.

Background

- Common malignancies: Lung (NSCLC), breast, kidney, colorectal
    carcinomas & melanomas

- Significantly more common than primary brain tumors

- 80% of brain metastasis occur in the cerebrum at grey/white matter
    junction

Presentation

- Highly variable: consider brain mets in any cancer pt w/ neurologic
    or behavioral changes

- Headache: worse in the mornings, with bending over or with valsalva

- Nausea/vomiting

- Cognitive dysfunction: changes in memory, mood or personality

- Focal neurologic deficits

- Signs of elevated ICP: papilledema, vision changes, drowsiness,
    presyncope

- Seizures

- Stroke (particularly in melanoma, choriocarcinoma, thyroid & renal
    carcinomas)

Evaluation

- STAT CT if concerned for stroke or elevated ICP

- MRI with contrast: most sensitive, can differentiate between
    metastases vs. other lesions

<!-- -->

- Suggestive features: multiple lesions, location, circumscribed
    margins, vasogenic edema

<!-- -->

- If pt has no known primary tumor: consider CT C/A/P +/- PET to
    identify primary

- Biopsy with histopathology & IHC: if diagnosis in doubt or if only a
    single lesion is present

Management

- If severe HA, N/V, focal deficits: systemic glucocorticoids

<!-- -->

- Dexamethasone 10mg IV x1 followed by 4mg IV q6h (can be PO if
    tolerated)

<!-- -->

- Stat/urgent consults:

<!-- -->

- Neurosurgery – for diagnostic/therapeutic intervention

- Radiation oncology – for radiation therapy

- Medical oncology – for help with diagnosis and chemotherapy

<!-- -->

- Ensure regular neuro-vascular checks and close monitoring

- Do not perform LP without input from neurology

Paraneoplastic Syndromes – Justin Lo

Hypercalcemia of malignancy

Background

- Caused by PTHrP production, osteolytic lesions, and/or rarely
    exogenous Vit D

<!-- -->

- PTHrP: Breast cancer, NSCLC (squamous)

- Osteolysis: Multiple Myeloma, Breast Cancer;

- Exogenous Vit D: Lymphoma

Evaluation

- Correct \[Ca+2\] for hypoalbuminemia: add 0.8 x (4.0 – albumin)

- Send basic hyperCa+2 work-up – PTH, Vit D, etc. (see hypercalcemia
    section)

- PTHrP is called “Parathyroid Hormone-related Peptide-ARUP” in Epic

Management

- First-line: IVF without calcium such as Normosol; goal urinary
    output of 150-200 mL/hr

<!-- -->

- Strict I/Os; Cautious IV fluids if pt w/cardiac or renal dysfunction

- Add Furosemide if hypervolemic (do not empirically start)

<!-- -->

- Second-line: Zoledronic acid 4mg IV (takes 24-48 hours to see
    effect)

- AMS or severe hypercalcemia (\>14mg/dL): calcitonin 4 IU/kg (req.
    attending approval)

SIADH

Background

- Euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia with urine sodium \>20 and
    typically urine Osm \>100

- Associated with: SCLC (most common), head/neck cancers, breast
    cancer

- See "Nephrology" for additional information

Management

- Free water restriction to 800mL/day

- Refractory: salt supplementation (e.g. salt tabs) +/- loop diuretic

Carcinoid Syndrome

Background

- Episodic flushing, diarrhea, wheezing/SOB due to secretion of
    histamine & serotonin

- Most common: Neuroendocrine tumors – GI (often with mets to liver
    and lung)

Evaluation

- Urine: UR 5-HIAA (ARUP)

- Imaging to identify tumor(s) (CT chest/abdomen/pelvis)

Management

- Short-term treatment: subQ or IV octreotide (see UpToDate for
    dosing)

- Antidiarrheals (Imodium, Lomotil, etc.) to slow transit

- Long-term treatment: depot (IM) forms of octreotide and lanreotide

Autoimmune encephalitis, encephalomyelitis, and myelitis

Background

- Encephalopathy (limbic or brainstem), +/- myelitis (limb ataxia,
    sensory deficits)

- Associated with small cell lung cancer and checkpoint inhibitor
    therapy

Evaluation

- LP: make sure to order CSF oligoclonal bands & CSF IgG index

- “Paraneoplastic AutoAb Eval-MAYO” (add "CSF" to the front of the
    order name if for LP)

- NMDA-R can be ordered as a standalone test

- CT head

- EEG if concern for subclinical seizures

Management

- Consult Neurology, for possible immunosuppressive therapy (steroids,
    IVIG)

Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS)

Background

- Muscle weakness due to autoantibody against calcium channels
    resulting in ↓ ACh release

- Associated with SCLC (most common) & lymphoma

Presentation:

- Proximal muscle weakness, diminished DTRs

Evaluation

- Nerve conduction studies: EMG w/ NCV

- Serum “Paraneoplastic AutoAb Eval-MAYO”

Management

Consult Neurology

Therapy Toxicities – Rahul Shah

Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Toxicities:

- Immune checkpoint inhibitors augment the endogenous immune response
    against tumors, which may lead to autoimmune-like toxicities, known
    as immune-related adverse events (irAEs)

- Treatment: low-dose glucocorticoids (prednisone, 0.5 mg/kg) for mild
    adverse events, high dose glucocorticoids (prednisone, 1-2 mg/kg)
    for severe adverse events

Cirrhosis Overview – Lee Richardson, Hannah Angle

Background

- Standard 1-liner for any patient with cirrhosis:

<!-- -->

- Example 1-liner: 65yo M with cirrhosis due to HCV decompensated by
    ascites and HE (MELD 25) who is listed for transplant and followed
    by Dr. Izzy

<!-- -->

- Etiology of cirrhosis: HCV\>HBV, EtOH, NASH, Wilson’s,
    hemochromatosis, A1AT deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, PSC, PBC,
    congestive hepatopathy (right heart failure), medication-induced

- Complications that cause decompensation: overt ascites (or hepatic
    hydrothorax), overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE), esophageal variceal
    hemorrhage (EVH)

- Always calculate daily MELD-Na scores (predicts 3 mo survival based
    on Tbili, Cr, INR, Na)

Evaluation

- Goals: establish cause of cirrhosis, evaluate for complications and
    treat accordingly, determine prognosis, and consider transplant
    evaluation

<!-- -->

- History:

<!-- -->

- Symptoms suggesting decompensation: confusion, sleep disturbances,
    abdominal swelling, lower extremity edema, scleral icterus/jaundice,
    pruritus, easy bruising/bleeding (skin, mouth, GI tract), dyspnea

- Social history: EtOH and drug use hx, date of last drink, average \#
    of drinks/day, duration of EtOH use, prior rehab, hx of DUI, if
    there has been continued EtOH use despite knowledge of liver
    disease; these factors all impact transplant candidacy

- Ascites: compliance with diuretics, compliance with salt
    restriction, frequency of paracentesis (volume removed, date of last
    para), h/o SBP

- HE: compliance with lactulose, \# of BMs per day, any potential
    triggers (see HE section)

- GIB/EVH: hematemesis, coffee ground emesis, melena, hematochezia
    (duration, volume, \# of bleeding episodes), last EGD (varices,
    banding) and colonoscopy, compliance with non-selective BBs

<!-- -->

- Physical exam: asterixis, ascites, edema/anasarca, splenomegaly,
    muscle wasting, gynecomastia, testicular atrophy, palmar erythema,
    spider angiomata, scleral icterus/jaundice, petechiae/ecchymoses,
    caput medusa, Terry’s nails

- Labs

<!-- -->

- Initial Workup: CMP, CBC, coags, UA, HCV/HBV, Fe studies, PEth

- Unless requested by hepatology, defer to outpatient: AFP, ANA, IgG,
    A1AT, ceruloplasmin, AMA (PBC), ASMA (AIH), anti-SLA (AIH), anti-LKM
    (AIH)

<!-- -->

- Imaging:

<!-- -->

- Abdominal US with duplex unless done in past 6 months or indication
    for repeating sooner (concern for new portal vein thrombosis)

- For transplant eval, needs triple phase CT A/P (contrasted study,
    arterial and venous phases) or MRI abdomen with contrast

<!-- -->

- Liver biopsy: gold standard for cirrhosis diagnosis but is not
    always needed if clinical presentation, labs, and imaging consistent
    with cirrhosis

Lab abnormalities

- Hyponatremia (see hyponatremia section below)

- Cirrhotic coagulopathy (increased INR): due to ↓ coagulation factor
    production

- Thrombocytopenia: due to splenic sequestration, ↓ TPO production

- Hypoalbuminemia: indications for 25% albumin transfusion – SBP
    (1.5g/kg on day 1, 1g/kg on day 3), LVP (6-8g/L of ascites), HRS
    (albumin challenge: 1g/kg/day with max 100 g/day x 2 days), hypoNa
    \<125 and refractory to fluid restriction

Management

- Nutrition: high protein diet, 2g Na restriction (if ascites
    present),

<!-- -->

- Consider MVI, folate, thiamine (particularly in pts with EtOH use
    disorder)

- Mediterranean diet for NASH

- Fluid restriction if hyponatremic

<!-- -->

- Immunizations: ensure up-to-date with HBV/HAV, PPSV23, Prevnar, Flu,
    COVID-19 vaccines

- Consider consulting Addiction Psych and Social Work for pts with
    EtOH use disorder - can assist with arranging Intensive Outpatient
    Program (IOP), Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)

- General screenings include: HCC screening (q6 months), EVH screening
    (see section below), monitor for other decompensations and treat
    accordingly, monitor MELD and consider transplant evaluation when
    \>15

- Refer to hepatology outpatient

Medication Tips:

- Pain: 2g limit Tylenol, No NSAIDs, limit sedating medications
    especially with HE.

<!-- -->

- Tramadol 25-50mg generally safe to use

<!-- -->

- Pruritus: Sarna lotion, can spot dose antihistamines. Can discuss
    with pharmacist/attending about starting sertraline, cholestyramine
    (interacts with many medications), or rifampin.

- Anxiety/insomnia: hydroxyzine, avoid benzodiazepines

- If needed for EtOH withdrawal, use lorazepam (Ativan) instead of
    chlordiazepoxide (Librium) or diazepam (Valium) due to its shorter
    half life

Liver Transplant (LT) Workup – Lauren Evers Carlini

Background

- Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD-Na) score: initially
    developed to predict survival following TIPS placement, though is
    now used to objectively rank patients in terms of priority for liver
    transplant (LT)

<!-- -->

- Factors in total bilirubin, creatinine, INR, and Na.

- Exception points given for complications like HCC and
    hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), leading to score in mid to high 20’s
    even if biologic MELD is low

- Highest score lasts for 7 days

<!-- -->

- Listing a pt for LT is determined by a multidisciplinary transplant
    committee

<!-- -->

- Acute liver failure pts take precedence over decompensated cirrhosis
    pts for LT

Evaluation

- Abdominal CT (triple phase) or MRI (multiphase with contrast) to
    evaluate for hepatic malignancy and vascular anatomy

- Infectious workup: TB testing, HIV, RPR, VZV, CMV, EBV, and
    Hepatitis A, B, and C

- Cardiac evaluation: EKG and TTE with bubble are required. Functional
    testing: CT coronaries with fractional flow, invasive angiography
    and intervention may be necessary depending on pre-test probability.

- PFT’s, carotid ultrasound, panorex, etc.

- Appropriate cancer screenings (colonoscopy, pap smear, mammogram,
    and PSA if applicable)

- DEXA scan

- Certification of completion of intensive outpatient program (IOP)
    for substance abuse

- Evaluation by hepatobiliary surgical team after obtaining cross
    sectional imaging

- Psychosocial evaluation (consult Psychiatry, social work)

- Current VUMC policy: pts should be abstinent from alcohol for no
    less than 3-6 months, although exceptions may be made for early
    liver transplant based on a very strict protocol. Discuss exception
    criteria with attending if suspect patient unlikely to survive
    hospitalization without transplant

Both living and deceased donor transplant are offered at VUMC. Donor
evaluation, however, cannot be started before the potential recipient is
deemed a candidate.

Ascites and Hepatic Hydrothorax – Lauren Evers Carlini, Thomas Strobel

Ascites

Background

- Associated with a reduction in 5 year survival from 80% to 30%.

- Most often due to portal hypertension. Less common causes include
    peritoneal or metastatic cancer, heart failure, tuberculosis,
    nephrotic syndrome, Budd-Chiari, sinusoidal obstructive syndrome
    (S.O.S), or complications from procedures and pancreatitis

| Grade           | Definition                               | Treatment                                           |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Grade 1 Ascites | Only seen on imaging                     | 2g Na restriction                                   |
| Grade 2 Ascites | Moderate, symmetric abdominal distension | 2g Na restriction, diuretics                        |
| Grade 3 Ascites | Marked, tense abdominal distension       | LVP + Na restriction, diuretics (unless refractory) |

Evaluation

- Bedside ultrasound on admission to confirm presence of ascites

- Diagnostic paracentesis in all pts with ascites on admission mainly
    to rule out occult SBP

<!-- -->

- Initial paracentesis or when cause of ascites is uncertain: Total
    Protein, serum and BF Albumin, cell count w/diff, culture

- Subsequent/Serial paracenteses: cell count w/diff, culture, protein

- Always inoculate culture bottles at bedside

<!-- -->

- There is no guideline for INR cutoff for paracentesis, although our
    procedure team often looks for INR \< 3.5 (IR usually doesn’t care
    about INR)

- Serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) = serum albumin - ascites
    albumin.

- Calculate PMNs from fluid (see SBP below)

- Other tests:

<!-- -->

- Triglycerides: if fluid is milky

- Cytology: if very concerned for peritoneal carcinomatosis. May need
    up to 3 separate samples (50ml or more) to be able to detect
    malignant cells

- ADA: if concern for peritoneal TB

- Hematocrit: For bloody appearing fluid (not just serosanguinous) to
    rule out hemoperitoneum. There needs to be a recent serum HCT for
    comparison.

- Amylase: If concerned for pancreatic ascites

- Glucose, LDH if concern about secondary peritonitis (see below)

Management

- 2000mg sodium restriction per day for all ascites (Grade 1-3)

- Diuretics (spironolactone and typically furosemide)

<!-- -->

- Start at 100mg of spironolactone with up titration to 400mg

- Furosemide is added if insufficient diuresis or if limited by
    hyperkalemia. Use more loop diuretics in patients with CKD.

- If Urine Na:K ratio \<1, indicates insufficient natriuresis. Can ↑
    doses to a max of 400:160

- If poor response can change to torsemide 10mg and ↑ to 40mg max (per
    single dose)

- Fluid restriction usually not necessary unless serum sodium \<125
    mmol/L

<!-- -->

- Large volume paracentesis should be performed for tense ascites or
    refractory ascites (grade 3), regardless of serum Cr. Pts should be
    tapped dry with each paracentesis

- Give 6-8g of albumin per liter of ascites removed, even if \< 5L

- Target weight loss of 0.5 kg/day when diuresing to avoid renal
    injury

- Discontinue NSAIDs and ACEI/ARB

Refractory Ascites:

- Two distinctions:

<!-- -->

- Diuretic-resistant: lack of response to diuretics (max
    spironolactone 400mg/lasix 160mg), Na restriction and rapid
    recurrence following paracentesis

- Diuretic-intractable: unable to tolerate diuretic therapy 2/2
    adverse drug effects (unexplained HE, AKI, K abnormalities, hypoNa,
    intractable muscle cramps)

<!-- -->

- Management aside from liver transplant:

<!-- -->

- Discontinue diuretics once refractory ascites has been established

- Consider oral midodrine; can be especially helpful if pt is also
    hypotensive

- Serial paracenteses, generally arranged OP with IR

- Consider TIPS (trans jugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt; has
    survival benefit). Following TIPS, cessation or decrease in ascites
    should occur in 4-6 weeks

- Consider discontinuing beta blockers in patients with refractory
    ascites if sBP \<90, SCr \>1.5, or Na \<130

Hepatic Hydrothorax

Background

- Transudative effusion, typically unilateral (75% right sided);
    reflects ascitic fluid that passes through defects in the diaphragm.
    10% can develop without clinical ascites.

- Present in 4-12% of cirrhotics and portends a poor prognosis (75%
    mortality within 90 days)

Evaluation

- Often suspected clinically, though must exclude
    pleural/cardiopulmonary process

- Thoracentesis will demonstrate a transudative effusion and should be
    evaluated with standard pleural fluid lab tests: cell count,
    protein, albumin, LDH, culture

<!-- -->

- Other considerations: triglycerides, amylase, hematocrit, cytology

<!-- -->

- Rule out SBE which is diagnosed the same as SBP (PMN\>250)

Management

- Similar management of ascites as noted above

- AVOID chest-tube placement. Associated with increased morbidity and
    mortality due to extensive loss of fluid, electrolytes and protein
    as well as increased infection risk

<!-- -->

- PleurX catheters can be considered for palliation (e.g., hospice
    patients)

<!-- -->

- Refractory Hydrothorax is defined similarly and managed similarly
    with serial thoracentesis or TIPS. For those who are not candidates,
    consider:

<!-- -->

- Chemical pleurodesis (not commonly performed at VUMC due to
    complications)

- Thoracoscopic mesh repair in pts with clear diaphragmatic deficits
    (not common practice at VUMC )

<!-- -->

- Management of spontaneous bacterial empyema is the same as in SBP
    (see below)

Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (SBP) – Patricia Checinski

Background

- Infection of ascitic fluid without evidence of a surgical
    intra-abdominal source

- Presentation: fever, abdominal pain, encephalopathy, renal failure,
    acidosis, and/or leukocytosis

Evaluation

- Any pt with cirrhosis and ascites who is admitted should have
    diagnostic paracentesis to rule out SBP. Delaying paracentesis \> 12
    hours is associated with a 2.7-fold increase in mortality.

- Obtain cell count with diff.

<!-- -->

- Calculate the PMNs: total nucleated cells x % neutrophils.

- PMNs \> 250 cells is diagnostic of SBP. If there are greater than
    100k RBCs, you should correct for them: for every 250 RBCs, subtract
    1 PMN

<!-- -->

- A positive ascitic bacterial culture with PMN \<250 is called
    bacterascites and asymptomatic patients should NOT receive
    antibiotics. You will also frequently see culture-negative SBP
    (neutrocytic ascites) which SHOULD be treated (see below).

Management

- Immediately start empiric antibiotics

<!-- -->

- Guidelines recommend cefotaxime IV 2gm q8 hours x 5 days, but we
    commonly use ceftriaxone IV 2g q24h for 5-7 days at VUMC and
    Nashville VA.

    - Most common culprits (E. coli, Klebsiella, streptococcal
        species, staphylococcal species)

    - If SBP developed with recent hospital admission (90 days),
        recent exposure to BSA, diagnosed \>48 hours of admission, or
        with sepsis, consider zosyn or meropenem to cover MDROs

<!-- -->

- IV albumin 1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1g/kg on day 3

- Discontinue beta-blockers once SBP develops and do not restart until
    SBP is completely treated, Na \>130, and no AKI

- PPI’s ↑ risk for SBP in pts with cirrhosis, and should be reviewed
    for appropriateness

- Repeat diagnostic paracentesis two days after antibiotics initiated

<!-- -->

- If \<25% decrease in PMNs, antibiotics should be broadened. Consider
    secondary bacterial peritonitis

Prophylaxis

- GI bleed: ceftriaxone 1g daily ciprofloxacin 500mg BID (preferred)
    or Bactrim one DS tablet BID x 5-7 days

- Outpatient lifelong ppx:

<!-- -->

- Indicated for:

    - Prior SBP

    - Ascitic protein \<1.5 AND

        - Child Pugh \>9 and bilirubin \>3 OR

        - Renal dysfunction (Cr \>1.2, Na \<130, or BUN \>25)

- Preferred: Bactrim DS tab daily or ciprofloxacin 500mg daily

- Alternatives: cefdinir 300mg daily, Augmentin 875/125 daily

If suspicion is high for secondary bacterial peritonitis:

- Examine serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG). SBP develops in pts
    with portal hypertension, defined by SAAG \> 1.1 g/dL. SBP is
    unlikely if SAAG is \< 1.1 g/dL.

- While not particularly sensitive, an ascitic leukocyte count of
    5-10k should prompt consideration of secondary peritonitis

- Amylase from fluid can also be helpful to point towards pancreatic
    ascites, while bilirubin can indicate gallbladder perforation.
    Peritoneal fluid CEA and alkaline phosphatase can additionally help
    identify hollow viscus injury.

- Evaluate with cross-sectional imaging and surgical consultation as
    appropriate

- Runyon’s Criteria to distinguish, requires 2/3 criteria below
    (protein, glucose, LDH)

|                 | Spontaneous          | Secondary     |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------|
| Protein (g/dL)  | \< 1                 | \> 1          |
| Glucose (mg/dL) | ≥50                  | \< 50         |
| LDH (U)         | Elevated, but \< 225 | \> 225        |
| Organisms       | 0-1                  | Polymicrobial |

Gastroesophageal Varices and Hemorrhage – Patricia Checinski

Background

- Varices form due to portosystemic collaterals in the setting of
    portal HTN

- The risk of mortality with each episode of esophageal variceal
    hemorrhage (EVH) is 15-25%

- Recurrence occurs in 60% of patients within 1-2 years of the index
    event

Variceal Screening

- Not all pts with cirrhosis require screening. Can be omitted without
    clinically significant portal hypertension (e.g. low liver stiffness
    (on elastography) and platelets \>150) or if pt already on
    non-selective beta blocker (NSBB) with HR 55-60

- Compensated cirrhosis without varices: EGD q3yr, unless active liver
    injury (obesity, EtOH use, ongoing viral infxn), then q2yr

- Compensated cirrhosis with small varices: EGD q2yr unless active
    liver injury, then q1yr

- Decompensated cirrhosis with no or small nonbleeding varices: EGD
    q1yr, and at initial time of decompensation

Management (Non-Bleeding Varices)

- Primary ppx with either NSBB (preferred) or endoscopic band ligation
    (EBL)

<!-- -->

- Nadolol (given nightly as portal pressures are highest at night) or
    propranolol (BID)

- Carvedilol has greater portal pressures and may be preferred if
    tolerated (goal 6.25mg BID)

- For 2 º ppx, initiate \~72hr after acute bleed has resolved and
    octreotide discontinued

- Discontinue if: hypotension (sBP \<90), AKI, SBP or hyponatremia
    with refractory ascites

<!-- -->

- Secondary ppx with both NSBB and EBL.

<!-- -->

- NSBB are associated with reduced mortality, while EBL is not

Management (Bleeding Varices)

- Place two large-bore IVs (18G or larger), resuscitate with blood
    products and albumin. Activate massive transfusion protocol if
    needed.

- Consider intubation if need for emergent EGD, change in mental
    status, ongoing hematemesis, concern of ability to protect airway

- Start octreotide 50 mcg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion of
    50 mcg/h, to be continued for at least 2 days should EVH be
    confirmed on endoscopy

- Ceftriaxone 1g IV q24h for SBP prophylaxis (reduced mortality), then
    transition to PO ciprofloxacin for total 7-day course

- Consult GI for upper endoscopy. Endoscopic therapies performed
    include variceal band ligation and sclerotherapy.

- Consider balloon tamponade with Blakemore as temporizing measure
    before definitive management. Patient must be intubated before
    placement, and preferably GI should be made aware prior to
    placement.

- No role for the correction of INR, even in the presence of bleeding
    as excessive blood products and FFP can increase portal pressures
    and cause worsening bleeding

<!-- -->

- Vitamin K can be given w/ ↑ INR, though is unlikely to help in the
    acute setting

- Check TEG and fibrinogen and transfuse based on results

- AASLD does not recommend specific platelet targets during variceal
    hemorrhage

- Administer blood products in balanced ratio to avoid transfusion
    related coagulopathy (VUMC MTP is 6:4:1 of RBC:FFP:PLT)

Hepatic Encephalopathy (HE)

Evaluation

- Asterixis: inability to maintain stable posture; many ways to assess

<!-- -->

- Check for clonus

- Have pt “hold out hands like you are stopping traffic” (if following
    commands)

- Shine light in pupil (look up video of hippus)

| Grade | Behavior Change                                                                                                    |

- Identify precipitants

<!-- -->

- Infection (rule out SBP in addition to CXR, BCx, UA/Cx),

- Medication non-adherence (lactulose)

- GI bleed (perform rectal exam and observe Hgb trend)

- Over-diuresis resulting in dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities
    (especially hypoK)

- Sedatives/benzo/opiate administration (UDS)

<!-- -->

- Ammonia (NH3) levels do not play a role in the acute management of
    HE

- Arterial NH3 is used in acute liver failure for prognostication (not
    for management)

Management

- Always determine precipitant and treat underlying condition

- Lactulose 30mL TID initially

<!-- -->

- Titrate dose to at least 4 BMs daily, avoid excessive stool output
    which may exacerbate HE due to dehydration and electrolyte
    abnormalities

- Consider lactulose enemas vs DHT placement if pt unable to tolerate
    PO

    - DHT are not contraindicated in patients with esophageal varices,
        but should be avoided in patients with recent hemorrhage or
        banding

- Add Rifaximin after the second episode of HE, or if failure to
    respond to lactulose

    - Frequently requires prior authorization for outpatient approval
        and is expensive

<!-- -->

- Lactulose is generally continued indefinitely after first episode of
    HE, though discontinuation can be considered if predisposing factors
    (recurrent infection, EVH, EtOH use) have resolved

AKI & Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS) – Garren Montgomery

Background

- Portal HTN causes shear stress on portal vessels endothelium release
    of vasodilators splanchnic vasodilation and reduced effective blood
    volume (decreased MAP) RAAS activation sodium and water retention
    and severe renal vasoconstriction

- Bacterial translocation (as seen in SBP) increased circulating
    pro-inflammatory cytokines splanchnic vasodilation

- Definitions:

<!-- -->

- HRS-AKI (formerly type I HRS): Rise in Cr ≥0.3 within 48h, rise in
    Cr ≥50% within 7 days, OR UOP \<0.5 mL/kg/hr for 6 hours

- HRS-NAKI (“non-AKI”) (formerly type II HRS):

    - HRS-AKD: eGFR\<60 for \<3 months in absence of other structural
        causes OR % rise in Cr ≤50% using last available Cr over last 3
        months as baseline

    - HRS-CKD: eGFR\<60 for ≥3 months in absence of other structural
        causes

<!-- -->

- Diagnostic Criteria

<!-- -->

- Diagnosis of AKI (see above) without other cause (see below)

- No response or inadequate response at 48 hrs after volume expansion
    with albumin and withdrawal of diuretics

- Absence of proteinuria (\<500 mg/d), absence of hematuria (\<50 RBCs
    per HPF), normal renal ultrasound (exclude if patient has known CKD)

- Suggestion of renal vasoconstriction with FeNa \<0.2, FeUrea \<20
    (most sensitive diagnostic measure). UNa \<20 is suggestive but not
    diagnostic given baseline sodium avidity in cirrhosis and inability
    to calculate FeNa

- Cut off for ATN in cirrhosis is a FeNa \>0.5, rather than 1 in the
    general population

Evaluation

- Step 1: Exclude other obvious causes of renal injury such as
    hypovolemia or ATN

<!-- -->

- Common precipitants of AKI: infection, overdiuresis, GI bleeding,
    recent LVP without subsequent volume expansion, nephrotoxic
    drugs/NSAIDs

- Workup: BMP, UA with microscopy, urine electrolytes (FeNa, FeUrea),
    urine protein/Cr ratio, renal ultrasound (to assess for chronicity),
    diagnostic para to rule out SBP

<!-- -->

- Step 2: Diuretic cessation/albumin challenge

<!-- -->

- STOP all diuretics, beta blockers, NSAIDs, ACE/ARBs,
    anti-hypertensives, vasodilators, nephrotoxins

- START volume expansion with albumin 1g/kg/day (up to a max of 100
    g/day) x2 days

<!-- -->

- Step 3: Diagnosis of HRS

<!-- -->

- If no other clear cause of AKI is identified and SCr has not
    improved after 48 hours of diuretic cessation and volume expansion,
    proceed promptly to vasopressor treatment

Management

- Pharmacologic therapies (in order of preference):

<!-- -->

- Terlipressin + albumin. Most effective combo based on clinical
    trials, NOW AVAILABLE (ongoing clinical trial at VUMC)

- Norepinephrine + albumin (25-50 g/day)

    - Most likely to be used at VUMC, requires central access (PICC vs
        triple lumen) but can be administered on stepdown unit

    - Guidelines recommend NE to be dosed at 0.5-3 mg/hr. Would ask
        fellow, attending or pharmacist for baseline. VUMC protocol for
        ICU and stepdown:

        - Start NE gtt at 3mcg/min. If UOP is \<200 or MAP \<10mm Hg
            from baseline, increase by 3 mcg/min every 4 hours

<!-- -->

- Continue to hold diuretics. LVP is still generally considered safe
    even in HRS if indicated by tense ascites (account for albumin
    repletion from LVP and HRS protocol). This can be attending specific
    and would confirm prior to performing

- Therapy is generally continued until HRS is reversed or the
    hepatology attending deems it refractory to medical treatment

- Patients with HRS-NAKI (formerly type II HRS) may respond to the
    above therapies, but recurrence of renal dysfunction after
    withdrawal of vasoconstrictors is the norm and thus current
    guidelines do not recommend them for this scenario

- RRT: Dialysis can be considered for those who fail to respond to
    pharmacologic therapy, particularly ONLY as a bridge to liver
    transplant. Decision to initiate should be individualized

- Liver transplant: The best and most definitive treatment regardless
    of response to pharmacologic therapy

    Simultaneous liver-kidney transplant:

- HRS often resolves with LT alone. Indications for kidney transplant
    are usually for patients with severe chronic renal dysfunction or on
    RRT. Must consult transplant nephrology.

- Criteria for SLKT:

<!-- -->

- eGFR \<60 for \>30 days AND latest eGFR \<30

- eGFR \<25 for \>6 consecutive weeks with a documented eGFR q7 days

- Metabolic syndromes and polycystic disease

<!-- -->

- Can qualify for safety net kidney transplant after liver transplant
    if eGFR \<20 2-12 months post-operatively (would be at higher
    priority than the rest of the kidney transplant list)

Hyponatremia in Cirrhosis – John Laurenzano

Background 

- Most commonly is hypervolemic hyponatremia, driven by release of ADH
    from decreased effective arterial blood volume (EABV) in the setting
    of portal hypertension

- Hyponatremia in cirrhosis is a marker of advanced disease and is
    associated with higher rates of SBP, HE, HRS, and mortality. 

Evaluation 

- Standard evaluation of hyponatremia, including Uosm, Sosm, UNa to
    rule out competing processes (e.g. beer potomania) 

Management 

- Discontinue anti-hypertensives (including beta blockers) in patients
    with ascites and hyponatremia. Hold diuretics when Na \<125 

- Fluid restriction is recommended only in patients with Na \<125.
    Restriction is generally effective at 1-1.5L and must be less than
    daily urine output to increase free water excretion 

- Replete potassium to 4.0, as potassium is as osmotically active and
    results in shifts in extra and intracellular fluids which lead to a
    net increase in serum sodium. 

- 25% albumin infusion (1g/kg split into BID dosing), has been shown
    to increase serum sodium and have higher rates of hyponatremia
    resolution at 30 days 

- Other treatment considerations include vasopressors, vaptans, urea
    tabs

- Salt tabs should not be used to raise serum Na due to worsening
    hypervolemia

- Nephrology should be consulted if not improved after 48 hours

Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt (TIPS) – Pakinam Mekki

Background

- A Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt or TIPS procedure is
    done by interventional radiology to manage sequelae of portal
    hypertension (specifically variceal bleeding and ascites)

- A low-resistance shunt is created between an intrahepatic branch of
    the portal vein and the hepatic vein, allowing blood to bypass the
    high-resistance vessels within the fibrotic liver

Evaluation

- Indications for TIPS

<!-- -->

- Variceal hemorrhage (esophageal, gastric, etc.)

    - Early “preemptive” TIPS is an urgent TIPS placement within 72
        hrs (preferably within 24 hours) of initial endoscopic
        hemostasis in pts at high risk for rebleeding (Child-Pugh Class
        B with active bleeding upon insertion of endoscope or Child-Pugh
        Class C with recent bleeding

    - “Rescue” TIPS is placed in pts with active, uncontrolled
        variceal bleeding or if bleeding recurs despite maximal
        endoscopic and pharmacologic therapy

- Refractory ascites (prolongs survival)

- Other: portal hypertensive gastropathy, PVT recanalization,
    Budd-Chiari syndrome, hepatic hydrothorax

<!-- -->

- Contraindications to TIPS

<!-- -->

- Absolute contraindications

    - Primary prevention of variceal bleeding, congestive heart
        failure, severe tricuspid regurgitation, severe pulmonary
        hypertension, multiple hepatic cysts or masses, Sepsis,
        unrelieved biliary obstruction

- Relative contraindications

    - Hepatic encephalopathy, hepatic tumors (especially if centrally
        located), thrombocytopenia, moderate pulmonary hypertension

<!-- -->

- Pre-procedure preparation

<!-- -->

- Labs: CBC, CMP, INR

- Liver imaging to assess portal system patency and exclude liver
    masses

    - Ideally triple phase CT with contrast

    - In pts with renal impairment or active variceal bleeding, RUQ
        U/S with doppler is acceptable

- TTE to evaluate for evidence of congestive heart failure, pulmonary
    hypertension, or valvular disease.

- Antibiotic ppx with ceftriaxone 1g IV once at the time of TIPS
    insertion as enteric bacteria within the static portal system can
    enter systemic circulation

- Patients with HE should receive rifaximin prophylaxis starting 2
    weeks before procedure

Management Post-TIPS

- Immediately following TIPS, pts are observed in the hospital
    overnight for complications

<!-- -->

- Monitor CBC and vitals closely. If hemodynamically unstable, STAT
    CBC and low threshold to obtain CTA A/P to evaluate for a bleeding
    source

<!-- -->

- TIPS causes a substantial increase in venous return to the heart,
    which can unmask cardiac dysfunction that was previously compensated
    for

- Obtain RUQ U/S with Doppler to assess shunt patency 1 month of TIPS
    placement, or if ascites and/or variceal hemorrhage reoccur

- If patient with a TIPS develops refractory HE, can consider TIPS
    revision to lessen HE symptoms

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) – Lee Richardson, Julie Cui

Background

- Pts with HCV cirrhosis are at greatest risk (incidence 2-4% per
    year)

- In chronic HBV and NASH, pts can develop HCC without having
    cirrhosis

Evaluation

- Regular screening in pts with cirrhosis (or chronic HBV without
    cirrhosis) for HCC

<!-- -->

- RUQ U/S q6mo (with or without AFP)

- Routine screening with CT or MRI is not recommended

<!-- -->

- Options If U/S not satisfactory:

<!-- -->

- CT A/P w/contrast, in comments specify triple phase for HCC
    screening

- MRI, specify Gadovist (preferred contrast agent)

- Contrast-enhanced ultrasound

<!-- -->

- AFP trend is more useful than one value in time, though AFP \>20
    should prompt multiphase CT or MRI for further evaluation

- Diagnosis can be made either by imaging (most common) or biopsy
    (rare)

<!-- -->

- Triple phase CT demonstrates strong early uptake in arterial phase,
    with subsequent wash-out in portal-venous phase

- If diagnosis remains unclear: can surveillance imaging or biopsy

- LI-RADS system notes risk of malignancy based on imaging
    characteristics

| LI-RADS      | What does it mean?         | What do we do?                                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LR-1 to LR-2 | Definitely/probably benign | Routine surveillance, consider diagnostic imaging within 6 mos                 |
| LR-3 to LR-4 | Indeterminate/probably HCC | Repeat or alternative diagnostic imaging in 3-6 mos. Consider Bx for LI-RADS 4 |
| LR-5         | Definitely HCC             | Plan treatment as noted below                                                  |
| LR-M         | Cancer, but may not be HCC |                                                                                |

Management

- Lesions that meet Milan criteria can qualify for MELD exception
    points and are considered transplant candidates

<!-- -->

- This accounts for pts with minimal synthetic dysfunction (and
    therefore low MELD)

<!-- -->

- Milan criteria:

<!-- -->

- Single tumor with diameter \>2cm but \<5 cm, no more than 3 tumors,
    each \<3 cm

- No signs of extra-hepatic involvement or vascular invasion

<!-- -->

- Liver transplant is definitive treatment, although resection can
    also be curative (favored in pts with early cirrhosis i.e. Child
    Pugh A)

- Locoregional therapies: Pts with unresectable disease, or who are
    not surgical candidates

| Therapy                                    | Details                                                                                                                |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Radiofrequency ablation                    | If in a favorable location and size, IR can percutaneously ablate with a large needle that emits microwave frequencies |
| Trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE)    | Chemotherapeutic agents injected into the tumor to occlude the feeding blood supply to the area.                       |
| Trans-arterial radioembolization (TARE)    | Like TACE, though radioactive compound (i.e. Y-90) used to occlude the feeding blood supply.                           |
| Stereotactic body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) | Radiation therapy: can be used as an alternative to ablation or trans-arterial therapy                                 |
| Systemic Chemotherapy                      | For metastatic disease                                                                                                 |

Coagulopathy in Cirrhosis – Garren Montgomery, John Laurenzano

Background

- The liver is responsible for production of both pro- (factor II, V,
    VII, IV, X, and XI) and anti-coagulants (protein C, S) in
    hemostasis. Factor VIII is the only one not made by the liver.

- Thrombocytopenia is caused by splenic sequestration from portal HTN,
    failure to produce thrombopoietin (TPO), and bone marrow failure

Evaluation

- INR/PT, and PTT are poorly reflective of bleeding risk

- TEG screens and other measures of comprehensive coagulation in
    cirrhotics

Management

- Even in bleeding, there is no need to intervene on an INR or
    platelet value

- Pre-procedural FFP is not recommended, even in the presence of
    bleeding, but is frequently requested by different proceduralists

- Low risk procedures (i.e., paracentesis) do not require
    pre-procedural blood products

- In bleeding pts, the following are recommended per AASLD and AGA
    guidelines

<!-- -->

- IV Vitamin K 10mg x 3 days

- FFP: Not recommended, unless as part of a balanced transfusion
    effort to avoid transfusion related coagulopathy, or if a TEG screen
    suggests potential benefit

- Cryoprecipitate: if fibrinogen \< 120

- Platelets: No specific targets regardless of bleeding.
    Pre-procedurally, recommend \>50

<!-- -->

- Appropriate DVT ppx should be given with few exceptions (plts \<50k,
    active hemorrhage)

- For TEG transfusion recommendations are as follows:

<!-- -->

- 10 mg/kg FFP if R-time \>10 minutes

- 1u Plts if maximum amplitude \<55 mm

- 5u cryo if alpha angle \<45

Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT) – John Laurenzano

Background

- Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT) can worsen decompensation (i.e.
    variceal hemorrhage), however, worsening portal HTN more sluggish
    flow increased risk PVT

Presentation

- Often identified asymptomatically on U/S, but can be identified by
    new or worsening decompensation of portal HTN

- Variceal hemorrhage is the most common decompensating event
    associated with PVT

- Intestinal ischemia (abdominal pain, hematochezia) from PVT is
    exceedingly rare but associated with significant morbidity and
    mortality

Evaluation

- RUQ U/S with doppler

<!-- -->

- Once identified, should be further assessed with triple phase CT or
    MRI with Gadovist contrast to exclude HCC with tumor thrombus

<!-- -->

- Pts with newly identified PVT should undergo EGD to evaluate for
    high-risk varices, both for diagnostic and therapeutic
    considerations

- PVT in pts without cirrhosis should prompt evaluation for
    hypercoagulable disorders

Management

- Start anticoagulation if acute thrombus occludes \>50% of main
    portal vein, \<50% but extends into SMV, thrombus is symptomatic, or
    patient is a transplant candidate (irrespective of size). Requires
    discussion with attending/transplant team.

<!-- -->

- Anticoagulation options: warfarin, LMWH, or DOAC

- DOAC’s are safe in Childs Class A, can be used with caution in
    Childs B, and are contraindicated in Childs C

<!-- -->

- Pts with chronic occlusive PVT (\>6 mos) or with cavernous
    transformation with collaterals do not generally benefit from
    anticoagulation

- Pts with high-risk varices should undergo endoscopic management or
    be on NSBB for prophylaxis for variceal hemorrhage, as noted above

- TIPS with portal vein recanalization has recently emerged as a
    therapeutic modality for PVT

- Pts should undergo follow up intermittently with ultrasound to
    assess for recanalization. AC may be stopped if there is failure to
    recanalize.

- If pts are not candidates for AC, they'll simply be treated for
    complications of portal HTN

Alcoholic Hepatitis – Alex Wiles, Julie Cui

Background

- Acute onset of rapidly progressive jaundice in pt with heavy EtOH
    intake (\>40g in females or \>60g in males EtOH/day for \>6 mos, or
    within \<60 days of abstinence)

<!-- -->

- May present after they have quit drinking due to immunosuppressive
    effects of alcohol

Evaluation

- AST \>60, AST/ALT \>1.5, both values \<400 IU/L; TBili \>3.0 mg/dL,
    documentation of heavy EtOH use until 8 weeks prior to presentation

- Prognostication with Maddrey’s Discriminant Function: 4.6 \* (PTpt –
    PTctrl) + Tbili

<!-- -->

- Maddrey \> 32 = poor 30d prognosis & may benefit from steroids (see
    below)

<!-- -->

- RUQ U/S to rule out obstructive cause of jaundice

- Biopsy is not typically required but will show neutrophilic lobular
    inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, steatosis, and pericellular
    fibrosis.

- Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) level is a biomarker of ethanol
    consumption over \~ 4wks; \>20 ng/mL can indicate chronic
    moderate/heavy alcohol intake

<!-- -->

- A single episode consumption can result in detectable Peth for up to
    12 days. Can be elevated for months with regular heavy alcohol
    intake

- EtOH levels may be negative unless acutely intoxicated

Management

- Supportive Care is essential! Consult nutrition, start high protein,
    high calorie diet, high dose Thiamine x 3d, Folate, MVI

- Full infection workup (CXR, UA, BCx, paracentesis) regardless of
    symptoms

- Steroids: STOP-AH Trial (NEJM 2015) showed improved mortality at 28
    days but not at 90 days in patients with Maddrey \> 32 who received
    steroids; the decision to treat is very nuanced and should be
    discussed with hepatology attending.

<!-- -->

- Prednisolone 40mg daily for pts who meet above criteria

    - Contraindications to steroids include: presence of infection
        (must rule out first including TB, uncontrolled GI bleeding, AKI
        w/ Cr \>2.5 mg/dL)

- The Lille score can be used to guide continuation of steroids after
    7 d of therapy

- NAC can be considered as adjunctive therapy to steroids and may
    decrease 30-day mortality, though has not demonstrated longer
    mortality benefit at 3 or 6 months

<!-- -->

- Monitor on CIWA

<!-- -->

- Psychiatry consultation as appropriate, consideration of medical
    therapy (see “Substance Use Disorders” section in psychiatry)

NASH and NAFLD – John Laurenzano

Background

- Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD): presence of hepatic
    steatosis in the absence of secondary causes (e.g, EtOH)

- Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH): evidence of active
    inflammation in conjunction with steatosis (elevated liver enzymes
    or evidence on bx)

- Strong association with metabolic syndrome, T2DM, HTN, obesity,
    prior cholecystectomy

- Generally asymptomatic

- Considered to be a common cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis

Evaluation

- NASH manifests with elevated liver enzymes, typically 2-5x the ULN,
    in a roughly 1:1 ratio (as opposed to alcoholic steatohepatitis),
    though ALT may be higher than AST

- NAFLD is asymptomatic and frequently found incidentally via imaging

- Exclusion of alternative causes and comorbid liver conditions: HCV,
    HBV, EtOH

- Note: Ferritin is frequently elevated, though not to the extent of
    hemochromatosis. Low level auto-antibodies are also frequently
    present

- Can be diagnosed based on imaging alone (and frequently is)

<!-- -->

- Ultrasound is used most frequently, though MRI and CT also are
    acceptable; use risk scores to determine the risk of advanced
    fibrosis and identify those who would benefit from biopsy

    - Fibrosis-4 (FIB 4) score

    - NAFLD fibrosis score

- More accurate, non-invasive fibrosis assessments can be done using
    elastography which can be vibration based (fibroscan), ultrasound
    based (sheer-wave), or MR-based

    - Available at VUMC and can be ordered by anyone. Insurance will
        not cover MRE if BMI \<35

Management

- Aggressive risk factor modification and management of comorbidities
    (HLD, HTN, T2DM)

- Weight loss: Mediterranean diet\>low fat diet (dose dependent
    improvement)

- No specific medications are FDA approved currently

<!-- -->

- Pioglitazone has shown benefit in pts with T2DM and NASH

- Vitamin E has shown benefit in pts without T2DM and proven NASH

- Ongoing studies for SGLT-2i and GLP-1ra; some promise indicated for
    the latter

<!-- -->

- While bariatric surgery is not a specific indication for NASH/NAFLD,
    increasing evidence demonstrates resolution of NASH and fibrosis in
    pts with clinically significant weight loss

- Referral to the surgical weight loss clinic should be considered in
    any patient who meets obesity guidelines for bariatric surgery (BMI
    \>40, or \>35 with metabolic comorbidities)

Additional Information

- Statins: should be used for HLD in pts with NASH, NAFLD and NASH
    cirrhosis

- Statin use in decompensated NASH cirrhosis is controversial, and
    they are less likely to derive benefit given overall poor prognosis.
    There is an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis in pts with acute on
    chronic liver failure and are considered contraindicated

- Metformin is safe and may have a survival benefit in patients with
    diabetes and cirrhosis. Discontinue only in those who have increased
    risk for lactic acidosis (renal impairment and significant EtOH).
    Sulfonylureas are generally avoided.

Acute Liver Injury and Failure – Jacob Parnell, Judd Heideman, Hannah
Lomzenski, and Lauren Chan

Background

- Acute liver injury (ALI): elevated liver enzymes + INR ≥1.5 but NO
    encephalopathy

- Acute liver failure (ALF): elevated liver enzymes +
    encephalopathy/AMS in the absence of pre-existing liver disease\*

<!-- -->

- \*Chronic autoimmune hepatitis, HBV, Wilson disease, and Budd-Chiari
    syndrome can have ALF if they develop new AMS, despite the presence
    of a pre-existing liver disease

<!-- -->

- Alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is not ALF (see above)

Etiology

- R-factor (if history, exam, and diagnostic data are inconclusive
    i.e. R-factor is not a replacement to clinical judgement) = (ALT/uln
    ALT) / (ALP/uln ALP); See chart below

<!-- -->

- R \> 5 = hepatocellular injury; R\<2 = cholestatic injury; R 2-5 =
    mixed injury

<!-- -->

- Isolated hyperbilirubinemia: Differentiate direct versus indirect

<!-- -->

- Direct: Refer to cholestatic pattern

- Indirect: Gilbert vs hemolysis

<!-- -->

- Drugs Associated with liver injury

<!-- -->

- Hepatocellular pattern: acarbose, Acetaminophen, Allopurinol,
    Amiodarone, Baclofen, Bupropion, Fluoxetine, HAART (Nevirapine),
    Kava kava, Isoniazid, Ketoconazole, Lisinopril, Losartan,

Evaluation

- Consult hepatology early! (to assist with workup AND for transplant
    evaluation)

- Labs:

- CBC w/diff, CMP, Dbili, Mg, Phos, T&S, BCx, UCx, PT/INR, aPTT,
    fibrinogen

- Amylase, lipase

- Beta-hCG for females of childbearing age

- ABG with arterial lactate, ammonia (arterial \>124 predicts
    mortality and CNS complications e.g., need for intubation, seizures,
    cerebral edema, \<75 very unlikely to develop ICH)

- Viral etiologies: Viral hepatitis serologies (HAV panel, HBV panel,
    HCV IgG +/- PCR quant, HDV if known HBV (with low or undetectable
    HBV load) as Misc Reference Test, Hepatitis E PCR sent as
    miscellaneous if pregnant or travel to southeast Asia), HIV p24 Ag
    and HIV Ab, EBV Qt, CMV Qt, HSV 1/2, Qt, VZV IgM/IgG

- Toxins: UDS, ethanol level +/- Peth, acetaminophen level (drawn ≥4
    hours after last known ingestion), salicylate level

- Autoimmune/genetic: ANA, ASMA, IgG, AMA (if predominantly elevated
    ALP), ceruloplasmin

<!-- -->

- Imaging:

<!-- -->

- RUQ U/S with doppler

- Consider CT with contrast in patients with normal renal function and
    high suspicion of Budd-Chiari syndrome or malignancy with negative
    ultrasound (better for assessing the hepatic veins) and helps with
    transplant evaluation

- Consider ERCP/MRCP for cholestatic etiologies

Criteria for Transplantation:

- King’s College criteria: helps identify patients needing transplant
    referral/consideration for acetaminophen overdose

<!-- -->

- Arterial pH \<7.3 after resuscitation and \>24 hr since ingestion,
    OR

- Arterial lactate \>3 after adequate fluid resuscitation, OR

- Grade III- IV HE, SCr \>3.4, and INR \>6.5 all within 24h period

<!-- -->

- ALF not due to acetaminophen: INR \> 6.5 OR 3 of the 5 following
    criteria:

<!-- -->

- Indeterminate non HAV, non HBV etiology, drug-induced hepatitis

- Age \<10 or \>40

- Interval of jaundice to onset of encephalopathy \>7 days

- Bilirubin \> 17.5mg/dl (300μmol/L)

- INR \>3.5

Management

- Any pt with concern for ALF should be cared for in MICU (even if
    mild change in mental status)

- Pts with ALF may die acutely from hypoglycemia, cerebral edema, and
    infection

- ABC’s:

<!-- -->

- Intubate for GCS \<8, Grade 3 or 4 HE

- IVF resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid (most pts are volume
    deplete; avoid hypotonic fluids due to risk of cerebral edema)

- Vasopressive agents for persistent hypotension (guidelines outline
    the choice of pressors and should be here)

<!-- -->

- Monitoring:

<!-- -->

- Q1-2h neuro checks, Q1-2h glucose checks

- Closely monitor CMP, INR q6-8 hrs

<!-- -->

- Treatment of Primary Injury

<!-- -->

- IV N-acetylcysteine: Must be given when acetaminophen toxicity is
    known or suspected. It may be considered in other etiologies of ALF
    as it may improve transplant-free survival especially those with ALF
    due to non acetaminophen DILI.

    - Initial loading dose = 150mg/kg over 1 hour, then 50mg/kg/hr for
        4 hours, then 100mg/kg/hr for 16 hours

    - Patients with early-stage hepatic encephalopathy (grade I/II)
        have increased transplant free survival, while those with grade
        III/IV do not

<!-- -->

- Treatment of Secondary Complications

<!-- -->

- Infection: Rule out infection with CXR, Blood cultures, UA for every
    ALF. Antibiotics only if progressing HE, signs of infection, or
    development of SIRS

- Cerebral edema/increased ICP:

    - Grade I-II hepatic encephalopathy: lactulose but should not be
        administered to the point of diarrhea, and may interfere with
        the surgical field by increasing bowel distention during liver
        transplantation

    - Grade III-IV hepatic encephalopathy: elevated HOB to 30 degrees,
        quiet and dimly lit room, should be intubated, and ICP monitor
        are recommended (if not feasible, hourly neuro checks can be an
        alternative). If ICP becomes elevated:

        - Mannitol (0.5-1g/kg) is first line

        - If high ICP is refractory to osmotic agents, consider
            phenobarbital, indomethacin, and/or cooling to 33-34 degrees
            Celsius if awaiting LT

        - Hyperventilation may be considered for impending ventilation

- Seizures: phenytoin (no evidence to support seizure ppx), short
    acting benzodiazepines if refractory

- Renal Failure: early CRRT if persistent metabolic acidosis, volume
    overload, falling UOP

- Coagulopathy: IV Vit K (at least one dose) routinely to rule out Vit
    K deficiency, products for invasive procedures or active bleeding
    only

- Metabolic: Correction of hypoglycemia and electrolyte abnormalities

- Circulatory dysfunction/shock: Goal MAP \>75 mmHg. Ensure
    intravascularly replete, add norepinephrine first line, vasopressin
    can be used second line but may increase ICP. Consider stress dose
    steroids for refractory shock.

<!-- -->

- Additional Supportive Care

<!-- -->

- PPI for bleeding ppx

- Enteral nutrition EARLY; avoid TPN if possible

- Prefer propofol for sedation for better neuro exams and may reduce
    cerebral blood flow

Specific Management by Etiology:

- Acetaminophen

<!-- -->

- Early toxicology consultation if suspected ingestion/overdose

- For acute management contact Poison Control 800-222-1222

- Activated charcoal within 4 hours of ingestion, most effective
    within 1 hour

- IV N-acetylcysteine per protocol, look up Rumack-Matthew Nomogram
    and consult with toxicology

    - In Epic: search “N-acetylcysteine” and select order set
        “Acetaminophen overdose”

<!-- -->

- AFLP/HELLP – delivery

- Amanita phalloides – IV fluid resuscitation, PO charcoal, IV
    penicillin, IV acetylcysteine

- Autoimmune – IV steroids following approval by hepatology (and
    typically post biopsy). Azathioprine generally deferred until
    cholestasis resolved (Mycophenolate can be used instead)

- Budd-Chiari – anticoagulation, IR-guided endovascular therapy,
    transplant (must rule out underlying malignancy and evaluate for
    thrombotic disorders)

- HAV/HEV – supportive care, consider ribavirin for ALF due to HEV

- HBV – nucleos(t)ide analogue; orthotopic liver transplant

- HSV – acyclovir

Telemetry – Ahmad Dbouk and Samuel Lazaroff

Background

- Many monitored pts do not have a true indication

<!-- -->

- Leads to alarm fatigue, unnecessary workups, and is expensive

<!-- -->

- Telemetry is not a substitute for more frequent vital signs

- Discuss frequently on rounds: always reassess need and indication

- Stable patients without troponin elevation or new arrythmias are
    typically appropriate for transfers without telemetry

Notable non-indications:

- PCI for non-ACS indication (i.e. pre-transplant), non-cardiac chest
    pain, pt with AICD admitted for non-cardiac condition, non-cardiac
    surgery, chronic rate-controlled AFib

- Contraindicated in hospice/comfort care

- Nearly all noncardiac conditions (i.e., undifferentiated sepsis,
    stable GI bleed, alcohol withdrawal) upon transfer out of ICU

Lines and Catheters – Ahmad Dbouk and Samuel Lazaroff

Foley Catheter

- Indications: urinary retention, close urine output monitoring in
    critical illness or renal failure, need for strict I&Os (ex:
    diuresis) and unable to be achieved without catheter, surgery, open
    sacral/perineal wounds with incontinence, patient comfort at end of
    life

<!-- -->

- Urinary incontinence alone is not an indication for foley catheter

<!-- -->

- Duration of use is biggest risk factor for CAUTI

<!-- -->

- Best way to prevent CAUTI is to avoid inappropriate placement

- Assess daily whether foley can be removed

<!-- -->

- Chronic Foleys generally should be exchanged at time of admission

- Any concern for catheter obstruction (particularly with blood clots)
    should prompt urgent urology consult for irrigation/intervention
    (typically after RN has attempted)

- Difficult foley placement

<!-- -->

- Make sure an attempt has been made with a Coudé catheter. This
    catheter has a curved tip that can be useful in patients with BPH

PICC

- Single lumen: long term Abx, stable IV access with intermittent
    draws

- Double lumen: special populations (ICU or chemo), TPN w/ lipids
    (incompatible with many IV medications)

- Risk factors for CLABSI/VTE: ↑↑duration, ↑↑number of lumens, left
    arm, lower extremity

- A note on midlines:

<!-- -->

- A midline is just a long PIV inserted into the deep veins in the
    arm, typically 6-15cm

    - For reference, when you place an US-guided IV, the “long” 18G
        needles at VUMC are 2.5 inches (\~6.4cm)

    - Not much benefit compared to US-guided IV. Useful for stable IV
        access for meds and fluids. Not a stable route for blood draws

G-Tube

- Troubleshooting: EGS consult for malposition/not functioning, wound
    consult for skin breakdown

- G-tube study: 30mL Gastrograffin via tube \[resident often must
    push\], and order KUB

Transitions of Care: Tips for Safe Discharges – Soibhan Kelley

Discharge from hospital represents a period of vulnerability for
patients. Medical errors (especially medication errors) following
discharge are exceedingly common and can lead to adverse events

At VUMC we are fortunate to have the Discharge Care Center

- Multidisciplinary team including nurses, social workers, care
    coordinators, and pharmacists

- Phone number is included on discharge paperwork and patients can
    contact them 24/7. The DCC also reaches out to patients through an
    automated system

How residents can promote safe discharges:

- **Communicate with patient’s outpatient team (i.e. PCP)**

<!-- -->

- Typically achieved through the discharge summary

    - Include a list of specific, actionable follow-up tasks and
        assign a responsible party. Place in easy-to-view spot at the
        top of the summary

        - Ex: Instead of writing “follow-up BMP after initiation of
            furosemide,” write “PCP to check BMP in 2 weeks after
            initiation of furosemide”

        - Include any pending studies and appointments from hospital
            admission

    - All relevant parties should receive a copy of the discharge
        summary (see appendices

        section for mechanics of discharge process)

        - It is useful to send patient with a printed copy of the
            discharge summary if they will follow-up outside VUMC

- For high-risk discharges (patients with poor health literacy, hx of
    being lost to follow-up, patients following up outside VUMC)
    consider calling PCP’s office to set follow-up

<!-- -->

- **Complete an accurate and thorough medication reconciliation**

<!-- -->

- An accurate discharge medication list depends on having a complete
    admission medication reconciliation (utilize pharmacy consult!)

    - Three steps to medication reconciliation:

        - Verification: Performing a Best Possible Medication History

        - Clarification: Checking that medications and doses are
            appropriate

        - Reconciliation: Record all medication changes

    - Seek to use at least two sources of information

    - Keep a list of any held or changed medications in your hospital
        course. Medication changes can be lost when not communicated
        during team transitions

    - Review medication changes on rounds and with pharmacist on day
        of discharge (bonus points for day prior to discharge)

- Highlight any significant medication changes on discharge summary

    - Can include as follow-up tasks if pertinent (ex: PCP to
        follow-up BP in 2 weeks. Losartan held on d/c due to AKI but
        anticipate need to reinitiate once Cr normalizes)

- Be sure to communicate any changes with the patient and/or caregiver

<!-- -->

- **Ensure that appropriate resources and follow-up appointments have
    been requested** (PT/OT, skilled or non-skilled nursing HH, PCP
    follow-up, etc.)

- **Effectively communicate discharge plan to patient**

<!-- -->

- Discuss medication changes, tasks for patient to complete, follow-up
    appointments

    - Key points should also be written in the patient instructions
        box

    - Useful to include educational sheets in the AVS (searchable in
        discharge navigator)

    - Utilize the teach-back method to ensure your instructions were
        effectively communicated

Enteral Nutrition – Soibhan Kelley

Indications for enteral feeding

- Patients with high nutritional risk who are unable to maintain their
    own intake

<!-- -->

- Guidelines recommend calculating nutritional risk based on validated
    scoring tool (ex: Malnutrition Screening Tool). This is usually
    completed by the nutrition team

- Recognize who would benefit from nutrition consult to assist with
    risk determination

    - Patients with \>5% weight loss in past 1-3 months or decreased
        oral intake coupled with increased metabolic demands due to
        medical illness or surgery

<!-- -->

- Patients with low nutritional risk may not need enteral feeding if
    it is anticipated they will resume intake in 5-7 days

- Critically ill patients: goal is early initiation of tube feeding
    (within 48 hours)

Contraindications to enteral nutrition

- Bowel obstruction or severe ileus

- Ischemic bowel

- Acute peritonitis

- Major gastrointestinal bleeding

- Intractable vomiting

- Significant hemodynamic instability

<!-- -->

- Patients who are not adequately volume resuscitated and have
    significant hemodynamic instability (i.e., have high pressor
    requirements) are thought to be at increased risk for bowel ischemia

    - Pressors in general are not a contraindication to tube feeds. Ok
        to start once pressors are down-trending or at a stable level

Initiating tube feeds

- Enteral access

<!-- -->

- Nasogastric or orogastric feeding tube in acute setting. See
    procedures section for tips on placement

- For most patients, enteral feeding is safe with gastric tube
    placement

    - Consider post-pyloric placement for patients with high
        aspiration risk, impaired gastric motility, or patients who have
        demonstrated intolerance with gastric feeding

- Consider percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement if
    anticipate enteral nutrition \>4 weeks

<!-- -->

- Choice of formula and rate

<!-- -->

- Place nutrition consult. RD will calculation caloric and protein
    needs to determine goal rate and formulation

- OK to start tube feeds prior to recommendations and adjust later,
    especially if recommendations will be delayed. It only takes a
    simple calculation to make a reasonable tube feeding plan

    - Use weight-based dosing for calorie requirements

        - Use 25-30 cal/kg (use ideal body weight for most patients,
            use actual weight for underweight patient) to estimate daily
            needs

    - Most common formula used at VUMC is Nutren 1.5 (1.5 cal/ml) or
        Novasource renal if significant renal impairment (2 cal/ml)

    - Patients may need additional free water (most tube feed formulas
        are comprised of 80-85% water but varies with type). Typically
        dose as bolus of free water every 4-6 hours.

        - May empirically try 250cc free water every 4 hours and
            monitor Na trends. May need more if already with a large
            fluid deficit (ex: hypernatremia) or if high volume losses

        - May use clinical calculators as below

- Calculate hourly rate based on daily calorie need and formula
    calorie density

    - Ex: Patient with IBW of 70Kg will need estimated 1,750 calories
        per day (70 x 25 cal/kg)

    - If using Nutren 1.5, this will equal 1,167 ml per day (1,750
        divided by 1.5 calories per ml). This would equal a goal rate of
        about 50ml per hour (rounded up) of Nutren 1.5

    - Resources for quick calculations:

        - Search for “tube feed cheat sheet” on google and will find
            reference tables on EMCrit.org that gives you rate per hour
            for different weights and formula types

        - Clincalc.com also has a useful enteral nutrition calculator

- Start initially at a low rate (such as 10 mL/hr) to assess
    tolerability and advance to goal

    - Advance quickly if no concern for refeeding syndrome (ex:
        increase by 10cc/hr q6h)

    - If risk for refeeding syndrome or other issues with
        tolerability, typically advance more slowly over several days

Potential Complications

- Aspiration

<!-- -->

- Recommendation to keep head of bed elevated at 30 to 45 degrees (low
    quality, mixed evidence). Consider risks of this positioning (ex:
    formation of pressure ulcers)

- Consider post-pyloric placement if issues with aspiration (low
    quality, mixed evidence)

<!-- -->

- Diarrhea or constipation

<!-- -->

- Consider wheat dextrin fiber supplement (low quality evidence) but
    discontinue if not associated with clinical improvement. Avoid less
    soluble fibers such as psyllium due to risk of clogging tube. Avoid
    in patients with reduced GI motility due to rare risk of bezoar
    formation

<!-- -->

- Hyperglycemia

<!-- -->

- See endocrine section for management

<!-- -->

- Refeeding syndrome

    Monitor q8 hour Mg, phos, K in high-risk patients (underweight,
    recent weight loss, prolonged poor intake) and advance to goal
    slowly

Guidelines for Pregnant Patients – Ahmad Dbouk and Samuel Lazaroff

Acute Cystitis

- Significantly increased prevalence in pregnancy

- Symptoms: dysuria (urgency/frequency common in pregnancy)

- Diagnosis: evidence of pyuria and \>103 cfu/ml (note, if neg would
    test for g/c)

- Treatment: Empiric with cephalexin, cefpodoxime,
    amoxicillin-clavulanate, fosfomycin. Nitrofurantoin ok in second or
    third trimester. Avoid Bactrim in first trimester and near term.
    Tailor based on culture results.

- Note that asymptomatic bacteriuria is treated in pregnancy (in
    contrast with general public). Same antibiotic choices as above

Pyelonephritis

- Symptoms: fever, flank pain, and nausea/vomiting, dysuria

- Diagnosis: clinical suspicion + pyuria and bacteriuria

- Treatment: IV antibiotics for 1st 24-48hrs; beta-lactams preferred

- Mild to moderate: ceftriaxone or cefepime

- Moderate to severe: piperacillin-tazobactam or meropenem

Hyperemesis Gravidarum

- Presentation: Hormone mediated nausea/vomiting typically starting
    before 9wks GA

- Differential: gastroenteritis, hepatitis, biliary tract disease,
    obstruction, pancreatitis, pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, ovarian
    torsion, DKA, hyperparathyroidism, migraines, preeclampsia

- Workup: BMP, mg, phos, LFTs, lipase (may be mildly elevated in HG),
    UA,

- Treatment:

<!-- -->

- First Line: Ginger, doxylamine (25mg PO q6), pyridoxine (20mg PO q6)

- Second Line: metoclopramide (10mg q6), Promethazine (12.5mg q6)

- Third Line: ondansetron (8mg q12hrs, after 1st trimester)

- Hydration: 1L LR on admission + banana bag q24hrs

Hypertension:

- Both gestational HTN and preeclampsia/HELLP are typically diagnosed
    \>20w GA

- Tx options: nifedipine, labetalol, methyldopa, hydral (2nd line),
    clonidine (2nd line)

- Avoid: ACEs, ARBs, MRAs, Nitroprusside

Diabetes

- Due to hormonal changes associated with pregnancy, pregnant patients
    are at higher risk for poor control and DKA

- Oral regimens are generally transitioned to insulin-based regimens.

GERD:

- 1st Line: Can use antacids; avoid sodium bicarbonate and magnesium
    trisilicate

- 2nd Line: Sucralfate 1g PO TID

- 3rd Line: Cimetidine 200mg (30min prior to eating)

Asthma

- Similar rescue and controller medications as in non-pregnant patient

- Would favor using LABA \> leukotriene receptor antagonists for
    additional therapy

Wounds − Adapted from Dr. Duggan’s Geriatrics Guide

To do when admitting a patient with wounds:

- Document ALL wounds that are present on admission. This affects
    reimbursement

- Use the Haiku app on your cell phone to document images of wounds in
    chart

- Wound Service hours are Monday through Friday, 6 AM - 2 PM

<!-- -->

- If there is an urgent/emergent wound need (i.e. needs surgical
    eval or management), consult the appropriate surgical service

- While awaiting consultation, initiate topical wound care orders
    (detailed below)

<!-- -->

- Consider contributing factors: nutritional, pressure-offloading
    equipment, wound supplies, PT/OT, home health nursing

Types of wounds

- Arterial wound - Calciphylaxis

- Venous leg wound - Fistula

- Diabetic foot wound - Abscess

- Vasculitis - Skin tear

- Pyoderma gangrenosum - Pressure injury

- Fungating lesion - Ischemic ulcers / gangrene

Vascular Wound Etiologies

- Arterial: located on distal ends of digits, shallow, well-defined
    borders, pale/necrotic wound bed, minimal exudate due to poor blood
    flow, cramping pain or a constant deep ache

- Diabetic: plantar surface of foot, callused wound margins; usually
    painless due to neuropathy

- Venous: located on medial malleolus or gravity dependent areas,
    irregular edges, ruddy red with yellow slough and copious exudate

Skin and Soft Tissue Infection (SSTI) – VASP

Cellulitis

Background

- DDx: erysipelas, pyomyositis, necrotizing fasciitis, osteomyelitis,
    venous stasis, shingles, gout

- Pathogens: Streptococcus species: Group A (most common), B, C, G,
    Staphylococcus aureus (including MSSA and MRSA)

<!-- -->

- Non-purulent, lymphangitis, or erysipelas? Think *Streptococcus*

- Purulence (abscess or boil)? Think *Staphylococcus*

<!-- -->

- Unique clinical scenarios and associated organisms/organisms to
    consider:

<!-- -->

- Dog/cat bite: *Pasteurella multicoda, Capnocytophaga canimorsus*

- Human bite: *Eikenella corrodens*, oral anaerobes, *S. aureus*

- Fresh water exposure: *Aeromonas hydropholia, Plesiomonas
    shigelloides*

- Saltwater exposure: *Vibrio vulnificus*

- Neutropenia, presence of ecthyma: Gram negatives (*Pseudomonas
    aeruginosa*)

- Immunocompromised: Fungal (*Candida* spp, *Cryptococcus*),
    *Nocardia*, non-tubercular mycobacteria)

- Burn patients: *Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Fusarium*

Evaluation

- Outline border of erythema and obtain urgent surgery consultation if
    rapid spread of infection, crepitus, air in tissues or pain
    dramatically out of proportion to exam

- Blood cultures (BCx): ONLY needed if systemic signs/symptoms of
    infection or immunocompromised (most pts will not need BCx or
    imaging)

- Ultrasound for underlying abscess

- CT/MRI w/contrast: if necrotizing fasciitis, pyomyositis or
    osteomyelitis suspected

- Bilateral lower extremity cellulitis is RARE and warrants further
    consideration of other non-infectious etiologies

- Elevation test: if erythema improves after elevating leg above the
    level of the heart for 1-2 minutes, less likely to be infectious
    cellulitis

Management

- Antibiotics for 5 days for uncomplicated; can extend to 10-14 days
    if little to no improvement, more extensive/serious infection, or if
    immunosuppressed

- Typically improvement is not seen until \>48 hours of antibiotics,
    usually longer

- Provide anti-*Staphylococcal* antibiotics for purulent cellulitis in
    addition to I&D, if abscess present

- Clinical appearance may often appear to worsen initially despite
    adequate therapy

- Always elevate the extremity for more rapid clinical improvement!

Necrotizing Fasciitis

Background

- Infection of the deeper soft tissues that causes necrosis along the
    muscle fascia and overlying subcutaneous fat that is rapidly
    progressive and lethal if not addressed

- Clinical cues include rapid spread, pain out of proportion to exam,
    crepitus and hemorrhagic bullae

Evaluation/Management

- SURGICAL EMERGENCY!

<!-- -->

- STAT consult to surgical service for emergent debridement (generally
    EGS vs ortho)

- Imaging does NOT rule out necrotizing fasciitis and should not delay
    these consultations

<!-- -->

- ID consult

<!-- -->

- Blood cultures, but this should not delay antibiotic administration

- Contact and droplet precautions x first 24h of abx therapy; after
    this, contact precautions only if draining or contained wounds

- Vancomycin + either piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375g IV q8h extended
    infusion OR cefepime 2gm IV q8h + clindamycin 600mg-900mg IV q8h
    (for antitoxin effects)

Genitourinary Infection – VASP

Asymptomatic Bacteriuria

Background

- Isolation of bacteria in an appropriately collected urine specimen
    from an individual without symptoms or signs of urinary tract
    infection. Bacteriuria, foul odor, urine appearance, pyuria, falls
    and/or confusion alone are not indicative of infection.

- Oliguric ESRD patients may have bacteriuria from colonization due to
    lack of flushing of bladder; avoid sending UA/UCx unless patient is
    symptomatic

- Treatment only required for specific populations:

<!-- -->

- Pregnant women (screening performed at 12 – 16 weeks)

- Anticipated urologic intervention - when requesting, be sure to ask
    for Micro help in identifying potential pathogens needing treatment
    vs. likely contaminants

- Some renal transplant recipients, depending on time since transplant

Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)

Background

- Clinical symptoms of UTI (dysuria/urgency/frequency/ hematuria) in
    non-pregnant, immunocompetent, neurologically intact pt with normal
    urologic anatomy and no indwelling urinary catheters

Management

- Empiric therapy

<!-- -->

- Nitrofurantoin monohydrate: 100 mg PO BID x 5 days (avoid if any
    concern for pyelonephritis or if creatinine clearance \<60)

- Cephalexin 250-500mg q6h x5-7 days

<!-- -->

- Alternative therapies

<!-- -->

- Fosfomycin: 3 grams of powder mixed in water as a single PO dose
    (avoid if any concern for ascending UTI or pyelonephritis).
    Susceptibility test results must be requested of micro lab and are
    only possible for E. coli and E. Faecalis.

- Amoxicillin-clavulanate: 875-125mg PO BID x5 days

- Ciprofloxacin: 250mg PO BID x3 days

    - FQ’s should be reserved for more serious infections than
        uncomplicated cystitis, and only after susceptibility results
        are confirmed given high rates of resistance

    - Adverse effect profile \>\> beta-lactams (i.e. QT-prolongation,
        tendinopathies)

<!-- -->

- Avoid amoxicillin, ampicillin, and Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
    (TMP-SMX) due to increasing resistance unless culture data with
    confirmed susceptibility

Additional Information

- MDR cystitis: ESBL isolates are increasingly common due to
    antibiotic overuse

<!-- -->

- Before treating, decide if this is a TRUE UTI

- If true, consider Fosfomycin (if *E. coli*) or nitrofurantoin (if
    susceptibility is confirmed – *K. pneumoniae* and *Enterobacter* spp
    are usually resistant), gentamicin or tobramycin 5-7mg/kg IV once,
    or ID consultation

- Ask the lab to check susceptibility results to these antibiotics for
    future reference

Complicated UTI and Pyelonephritis

Background

- Fever, pyuria, and costovertebral angle tenderness suggest
    pyelonephritis.

- Consider it a complicated UTI if any of the following are present:

<!-- -->

- Renal calculi or other obstructive disease, immunosuppressed host,
    abnormal urological anatomy or physiology (including stents),
    presence of a urinary catheter

- Male sex alone does NOT qualify as complicated

Evaluation

- UA with reflex urine culture

- BCx and UCx prior to antibiotics

- If there is no pyuria, consider an alternative diagnosis, or
    proximal ureteral obstruction

<!-- -->

- Pyuria is common in the presence of a urinary catheter, kidney
    stones, urostomy, ileal conduit and other invasive devices, and may
    not indicate infection

Management

- Antibiotic Duration: 7-14 days, depending on antibiotic choice

- Tailor therapy once/if cultures are available. If no improvement in
    48h, consider imaging to rule out complications (e.g., perinephric
    abscess)

\*FQ’s have same bioavailability if given PO or IV so oral is preferred

Catheter Associated Urinary Tract Infection (CAUTI)

Background

- Culture growth of \> 10<sup>3</sup> cfu/mL of uropathogenic
    bacteria + signs or symptoms consistent with infection (without
    another identified etiology) + indwelling urethral/suprapubic
    catheter or intermittent catheterization.

<!-- -->

- This includes pts with catheters in place during the preceding 48
    hours

<!-- -->

- Duration = greatest risk factor (Increases 3-10% per day of
    catheterization)

<!-- -->

- Other risks: female sex, diabetes, elderly, colonization of catheter
    bag, poor care

<!-- -->

- Bacteriuria, foul odor, pyuria, urine appearance falls and/or
    confusion alone are not indicative of infection in patients who are
    otherwise asymptomatic.

- Ensure clean sample collected

<!-- -->

- Ideally, catheter is removed and midstream sample obtained

- If catheterization required; removal of old catheter and sample
    taken from new catheter

Management

- Distinguish uncomplicated vs complicated UTI (see above)

- Antimicrobial management:

<!-- -->

- Guided by cultures and susceptibilities

- Empiric guidance as per management of uncomplicated/complicated UTI
    and per prior culture data/susceptibilities when available.

- Duration: 7 – 14 days depending on antibiotic, clinical response and
    whether infection constitutes complicated vs uncomplicated UTI

- Special note regarding *Candida* UTI management: *Candida* is
    generally not pathogenic

    - Presence in urine does not indicate infection (unless
        perinephric abscess, renal transplant, or complex fistulous
        disease)

    - Fluconazole achieves excellent urinary penetration

    - If fluconazole-resistant *Candida* is cultured or suspected,
        consult ID

    - Susceptibilities are not routinely run-on *Candida* from urine
        cultures and would need to be requested if concern for true
        infection.

<!-- -->

- Catheter management

<!-- -->

- At the least, catheters should be replaced at the time of antibiotic
    initiation (preferably removed)

- If catheterization is necessary, intermittent catheterization is
    preferred over continuous use with patient educations on
    cleaning/hygiene prior to catheterization. Condom catheters and pure
    wicks also preferred over foley catheter

Sexually Transmitted Infections – Ashley Zeoli

Gonorrhea

Background

- Cause: gram-negative coccus *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*

- Gonorrhea causes a spectrum of disease including urethritis,
    cervicitis, epididymitis, proctitis, pharyngeal infections,
    conjunctivitis, PID, and disseminated gonococcal infection

Evaluation

- Microbial diagnosis is required to diagnose gonorrhea, rather than
    clinical diagnosis alone

- Test of choice: NAAT of the first-catch urine in men; NAAT of
    vaginal swab in women

<!-- -->

- Also perform co-testing for chlamydia

<!-- -->

- NAAT of pharyngeal or rectal swab should also be performed in
    patients with reported symptoms and recent sexual exposure. Note
    this is also routine testing in patients on PREP.

- Routine screening should be offered to sexually active patients, as
    many are asymptomatic

Management

- Ceftriaxone is the only current antibiotic that meets the strict
    treatment efficacy goals with single-dose therapy. CTX also has a
    low rate of drug resistance, which is becoming an increasing issue
    in the treatment of gonorrhea.

<!-- -->

- **High dose IM ceftriaxone** (\<150kg 500mg IM; \>150mg 1g IM)

    - Same for pharyngitis or conjunctivitis

- CTX allergies: Azithromycin (2g PO x1) + Gentamicin (240mg IM x1) or
    Gemifloxacin

<!-- -->

- Treatment of chlamydia must also be accompanied with gonorrhea
    treatment when it has not been excluded with molecular testing.

<!-- -->

- Doxycycline 100mg BID for 7 days

<!-- -->

- Patients who have persistent symptoms despite treatment should be
    suspected of having resistant gonorrhea. Test with culture and
    antimicrobial susceptibility testing (with or without NAAT).

- Patients with recurrent symptoms after period of resolution should
    be re-evaluated for gonorrhea and other STIs

Chlamydia

Background

- Cause: gram negative bacteria *Chlamydia trachomatis*

- Most individuals are asymptomatic though causes a wide array of
    infections: urethritis, cervicitis PID, conjunctivitis,
    perihepatitis (Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome), pneumonia, proctitis,
    epididymitis, reactive arthritis, pharyngitis, lymphogranuloma
    venereum (LGV), endemic trachoma

- Differential diagnosis: Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas
    vaginalis, Mycoplasma genitalium

Evaluation

- Test of choice: NAAT of vaginal swab in females (first catch urine
    also adequate); NAAT of first catch urine in males.

- NAATs can detect both LGV and non-LGV chlamydia trachomatis, but
    cannot distinguish between them

- Any patient with signs and symptoms concerning for chlamydia should
    be tested. Testing should also routinely be offered to sexually
    active individuals since most patients are asymptomatic. Note this
    is also routine testing in patients on PREP.

Management

- **Doxycycline** **100mg BID x 7 days** is the preferred treatment in
    non-pregnant patients (azithromycin is NOT preferred)

<!-- -->

- Alternative treatment options (for allergies/severe
    contraindications): azithromycin (1g PO x 1), levofloxacin (500mg PO
    daily x7 days), and ofloxacin (300mg BID PO x7 days)

<!-- -->

- Patients with recent potential or confirmed exposure within the last
    1-2 weeks should be treated empirically

- Patients with persistent symptoms, confirmed infection, and who
    already underwent appropriate treatment, likely have a re-infection,
    rather than treatment failure. Test again.

- Patients with recurrent symptoms after resolution should be
    re-tested for chlamydia with a NAAT and other STIs (gonorrhea, BV,
    etc).

- Empiric therapy for gonorrhea should be given to patients unless
    NAAT is negative

Syphilis

Background

- Caused by the spirochete, *Treponema pallidum,* which is visualized
    by dark field microscopy

- High rate of HIV co-infection among MSM with syphilis (\~42%)

- Transmitted by direct contact with an infectious lesion during sex.
    Infection can occur anywhere inoculation occurs (i.e. contact with
    infected secretions can result in a lesion on any tissue site)

- Can readily cross the placenta fetal infection

- Patients can present with a variety of symptoms, depending on their
    place in the disease course

Evaluation

- Test all patients with signs and symptoms, as well as patients who
    are at increased risk for acquiring infection (patients with sexual
    partner with early syphilis, MSM, people living with HIV, high risk
    sexual behaviors, and history of commercial sex work or
    incarceration)

- HIV testing should be offered to all patients who test positive

- Pregnant patients should be screened for syphilis

- There are two types of serologic tests: treponemal-specific tests
    (FTA-ABS, MHA-TP, TPPA, TP-EIA, CIA) and nontreponemal tests (RPR,
    VDRL, TRUST). Either can be used as initial screening, but
    confirmatory testing with the other is needed due to false
    positives.

<!-- -->

- Treponemal specific are usually used as confirmatory tests when
    nontreponemal tests are reactive. They are reported as reactive or
    non-reactive. Once positive, usually positive for life.

- Nontreponemal quantifies amount of antibody present and can be used
    to detect titers to assess for treatment. Titers should decline
    after a patient has been treated. A rise in titers in a previously
    treated patient should be concerning for new infection.

    - Requires a humoral response, so can be false negatives if
        immunocompromised

    - False positives: autoimmune diseases, pregnancy, other
        infections

<!-- -->

- At VUMC, a positive treponemal IgG reflexes to a RPR titer.

- Neurosyphilis can occur at any time after infection. All newly
    diagnosed patients with syphilis should have a full neurologic exam
    and if any abnormalities should have an LP sent for CSF-VDRL.

- Any patients with syphilis and vision changes should get an
    ophthalmology evaluation.

Pulmonary Infections – VASP, Evan Schwartz

Acute Bronchitis

Background

- 1-3 wks productive cough, often preceded by URI, may have
    wheezing/rhonchi

- Distinct from chronic bronchitis (\>3 mos of consecutive cough x 2
    consecutive yrs)

- Distinct from PNA (parenchymal consolidation, fever \>100.4F,
    hypoxia, tachypnea)

- DDx: COVID-19, post-nasal drip, GERD, undertreated/new asthma, ACE-i
    induced bradykinin cough, undertreated CHF, acute PE, or new lung
    cancer

- Typically a clinical dx; CXR/labs not necessary unless PNA suspected

Management

- Supportive: lozenges, cough suppressants (guaifenesin or
    dextromethorphan), smoking cessation. Consider albuterol inhaler for
    wheezing

- No indication for antibiotics

Influenza

Background

- Dx often clinical w/cough, sore throat, \#sputum/nasal discharge,
    HA, fever, myalgias, and malaise; ± N/V/D. Exam with increased
    flushing, rarely with lower respiratory symptoms

Evaluation

- During flu season: Obtain COVID/RPP or dedicated influenza PCR;
    testing is more accurate if obtained within 96 hour of symptom onset

- CXR if concerned for bacterial superinfection

Management

- Antivirals most effective when given \<48 hours from symptom onset;
    however, recommended to be given if symptomatic despite duration and
    to all hospitalized patients

- Oseltamivir 75mg BID x 5 days, peramivir 600mg IV x 1 (needs renal
    adjustment), or baloxavir (age ≥12) 40mg once (use 80 mg if \>80kg)

- Amantadine and rimantadine are no longer used due to emerging
    resistance

Inpatient COVID-19 Management – Kathryn Snyder

Background

- COVID-19 is the novel coronavirus responsible for the ongoing
    pandemic that started in late 2019. The virus has ongoing mutations
    resulting in new dominant strains.

Evaluation

- Please see the most updated VUMC and VA guidance due to frequently
    evolving recommendations.

- Please refer to the hospital’s current maximum oxygen requirement
    allowed on the floor to ensure patient is appropriately triaged.

- Basic admission workup for symptomatic, confirmed COVID-19

<!-- -->

- Labs: CBC with diff, CMP, d-dimer, ferritin, CRP, ESR, PT/INR, PTT,
    procalcitonin, RPP

- Imaging: portable CXR

- Nursing: Strict I/O

- Enhanced precautions (contact, airborne, eye protection)

Management

- Fluid balance goal slightly net negative to even

- Anticoagulation/DVT prophylaxis:

<!-- -->

- Please see latest VUMC or VA guidance based on clinical status
    (supplemental O2 requirements, ICU vs floor, etc.)

<!-- -->

- Pharmacologic therapies

<!-- -->

- Note: Therapies, indications, and contraindications are frequently
    changing, please see latest VUMC/VA guidelines for specific
    indications for these medications or others

- Remdesivir

        clinical improvement or persistently elevated CRP

    - Contraindications: no hard contraindications, use clinical
        judgement if concomitant serious bacterial/fungal infection

- Antibiotics:

    - The incidence of superimposed bacterial infection in the setting
        of COVID-19 is low

    - The majority of patients do not need additional coverage for
        bacterial pneumonia

    - You can use procalcitonin to guide decision

- Other pharmacologic therapies include baricitinib (JAK inhibitor),
    tocilizumab (IL-6 inhibitor) and monoclonal antibodies

Additional Information

- Complications and special considerations for COVID-19 patients

<!-- -->

- High PE/DVT risk

- Superimposed bacterial PNA

- AKI

- GI symptoms/abnormalities (see GI section on COVID-19)

Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)

Background

- All PNA that does not otherwise meet criteria for Hospital Acquired
    Pneumonia (PNA that develops ≥48 hours after hospital admission),
    Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (PNA that develops ≥48-72 hours
    after endotracheal intubation), or aspiration PNA

- Healthcare-associated pneumonia is no longer a clinical entity per
    2016 IDSA guidelines

- MRSA Risk Factors: recent history, cavitary lesion, post-influenza
    bacterial PNA, pts with IDU, severe hypoxemia requiring intubation

- *Pseudomonas*: Double coverage is not indicated in general
    population; LVQ has 82% sensitivity so not recommended unless
    isolate proven susceptible

Evaluation

- Sputum cultures prior to abx, consider BCx in select groups (severe
    pneumonia, ICU admission, cavitary disease, immunosuppression).

- Rule out flu if the right season, COVID-19, consider RVP if it will
    change management

- CURB-65 or PSI can aid in decision between outpatient vs inpatient
    therapy

<!-- -->

- CURB65: Confusion, Uremia (BUN \>=19 mg/dL), RR (\>30/min),
    BP(\<90/60 mmHg), Age ≥ 65 If ≥ 2, hospitalization is recommended.

<!-- -->

- Consider urine pneumococcal Ag, urine Legionella Ag in severe CAP
    and in certain pts (e.g., neutropenia, asplenia, obstructive lung
    disease, hyponatremia, diarrhea, or heavy alcohol use); these are
    performed at reference labs and will take several days to return.

- CRP, ESR, and pro-calcitonin have not been shown to reliably improve
    outcomes; however, pro-calcitonin \< 0.25 suggests against bacterial
    respiratory infection and antibiotic discontinuation is encouraged

- PA/ lateral CXR to evaluate for and localize infiltrate. If
    immunocompromised, consider CT chest w/o contrast (does not improve
    outcomes)

<!-- -->

- Lobar Consolidation - likely bacterial

- Interstitial Infiltrate - likely atypical vs. viral vs.
    non-infectious

- Cavitation - concerning for fungal vs. necrotizing vs. mycobacterial

Management

- Antibiotic Duration: 5-7 days (at least 5 days and improvement with
    clinical stability)

\*No chronic heart, lung, liver, renal disease, DM, alcoholism,
immunocompromise

Additional Information

- MRSA nasal swab has reported negative predictive value for MRSA
    pneumonia ranging 95% to \>99%; consider sending and if negative,
    discontinue MRSA agent

- CTX is generally adequate coverage for aspiration PNA without
    evidence of abscess, empyema, or cavitary lesion on imaging

- Aspiration pneumonia can be confused for aspiration pneumonitis
    which does not need to be treated with antibiotics. Rapid resolution
    of leukocytosis and stabilization of vitals suggest aspiration
    pneumonitis and consideration of stopping antibiotics.

- There is low sensitivity of S. pneumoniae to azithromycin (42%) and
    doxycycline (72%), so these should not be used as monotherapy

- Check for drug interactions with linezolid (e.g., SSRI, methadone,
    methamphetamine use)

Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) and Ventilator Associated Pneumonia
(VAP)

Background

- HAP: Pneumonia that develops \>48 hours after admission

- VAP: Pneumonia that develops \>48 hours after endotracheal
    intubation

Evaluation

- Cultures of blood, sputum, endotracheal aspirate and/or bronchoscopy
    specimen

- Consider MRSA nares to help with de-escalation

- If there is concern for respiratory viruses: send influenza, COVID,
    RVP

Management

- Initially cover for MRSA and *Pseudomonas*

- Antibiotic Duration: 7 days in uncomplicated cases, although
    specific pathogens (e.g., *Pseudomonas*) may require longer duration
    and ID guidance

- Consider ID consultation if the patient is not clinically improving
    on empiric therapy or if an MDR pathogen grows from culture

- If no MRSA isolated and pt is improving, consider stopping
    vancomycin ASAP

- There is concern for nephrotoxicity with combination Vancomycin and
    piperacillin-tazobactam, but data controversial

Diabetic Foot Infection – VASP

Evaluation

- Plain radiograph for all pts; MRI w/contrast if abscess/osteo
    suspected

- BCx (prior to antibiotics) if systemic signs of infection, or severe
    infection

<!-- -->

- Do not culture swabs of lesions, as these generally only grow
    colonizing organisms.

<!-- -->

- Consult podiatry if osteomyelitis present for bone specimen culture
    and pathology (either from debridement specimen or bone biopsy)
    prior to starting antibiotics.

- Consult surgery if concern for abscess, gas in tissue, joint
    involvement

- Assess peripheral vasculature, consider arterial flow
    studies/vascular surgery consult

Management

- Assess Severity:

<!-- -->

- Mild: Local infxn, skin/subQ tissue only, erythema \>0.5 cm but ≤2cm
    from ulcer

- Moderate: Local infxn w/erythema \> 2 cm from ulcer or deeper
    structures included without SIRS

- Severe: Local infxn with systemic inflammation as evidenced by \>2
    SIRS criteria

    - Consider anti-pseudomonal coverage if at risk for *Pseudomonas*
        infection (e.g. wet; failure of prior antibiotic therapy;
        chronic wound).

    - Consider anaerobic coverage with metronidazole if foul-smelling
        and/or necrotic.

Additional Information

- If pt HDS, hold abx until deep tissue/operative cultures obtained.

- Most diabetic foot infections are polymicrobial in nature.

- Culture results may guide therapy, but all pathogens identified may
    not require treatment.

Joint Infections and Osteomyelitis – VASP

Evaluation

- Blood cultures prior to antibiotics

- MRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for
    osteomyelitis.

- Ortho consult for joint fluid aspirate or bone bx; send for culture
    and send fluid for cell count/differential.

Management

- Hold antibiotics until culture obtained, if patient is clinically
    stable

- Osteomyelitis is a 6-week treatment course, can consider early
    transition (at 2-3 weeks) to oral if good bioavailability and
    susceptibility.

- For prosthetic joint infection, procedure/retention of hardware
    determines duration

- First line empiric: Vancomycin + ciprofloxacin 750mg BID

- Antimicrobial therapy will ultimately be guided by culture data, ID
    consult recommended for joint infection treatment due to need for
    prolonged antibiotic therapy

Bacteremia: Interpreting GenMark ePlex® Results – VASP

Background

- When BCx turn positive, the lab reports Gram stain and GenMark
    ePlex® results to help guide empiric therapy, while awaiting further
    species identification and susceptibilities.

Management

- Start empiric antibiotic therapy (based on clinical picture and
    table below)

- Consider ordering repeat BCx x2 based on organism to document
    clearance

<!-- -->

- Repeat for: *Staph* (MRSA or MSSA), *Strep lugdunensis*

- If source control & no endovascular infxn, no need to repeat (most
    other strep and GNR’s)

<!-- -->

- [VUMC
    antibiograms](https://www.vumc.org/antimicrobial-stewardship-program/antibiograms)
    can be used to reference typical resistance patterns and most common
    organisms in blood cultures.

- *Candida* in a blood culture is NEVER considered a contaminant

Endocarditis – Justin Smith

Background

- Multiple etiologies of endocarditis:

<!-- -->

- Typical Bacterial

    - *S. aureus, Enterococcus* spp (*E. faecalis* most commonly),
        viridans group *streptococci*, *Strep gallolyticus* (formerly
        *S. bovis*)

    - HACEK: *Haemophilus, Aggregatibacter, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, Kingella*

- Other infectious

    - Culture negative: often recent antimicrobial exposure, slow
        growing organism
    - *Coxiella*, *Brucella*, *Bartonella*, *Chlamydia*, *Legionella*,
        *Mycoplasma*, *Tropheryma whipplei*, *Cutibacterium acnes* (formerly *P. acnes*)
    - Fungal: *Candida* and *aspergillus* most common

- Non-infectious: a.k.a., marantic endocarditis, Libbman-Sacks
    Endocarditis

    - Rare, most common in advanced malignancy, SLE, inflammatory
        conditions
    - Higher risk for embolization compared to IE
    - Risk factors: IV drug use, congenital heart disease, valve
        abnormalities, intracardiac devices, recent cardiac surgery

Presentation

- Fever (90%), murmur (85%), other: splenomegaly, splinter
    hemorrhages, Janeway lesions, Osler nodes, Roth spots

- Persistent bacteremia despite appropriate treatment, new onset
    cardiac dysfunction, new onset valve abnormalities, stroke, other
    thromboembolic events, metastatic infections/abscesses, splenic
    abscess, septic pulmonary emboli

Duke Criteria:

- Pathologic Criteria

<!-- -->

- Microorganisms: culture or histology proven: vegetation, embolus, or
    intracardiac abscess

- Pathologic vegetations: vegetation of abscess with histology proven
    endocarditis

<!-- -->

- Clinical Criteria

<!-- -->

- Definite: 2 Major, 1 major and 3 minor, or 5 minor

- Possible: 1 major and 1 minor, or 3 minor

- Rejected: firm alternate diagnosis, resolution of evidence with \<4
    days of antibiotics, or absence of pathologic evidence with \<4days
    of antibiotics

| **Major Criteria**                                 | **Minor Criteria**                                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2x positive blood cultures from a typical organism | Predisposing heart condition/IDU                                                    |
| Evidence of endocardial involvement                | Fever                                                                               |
|                                                    | Vascular phenomena (glomerulonephritis)                                             |
|                                                    | Immunologic phenomena (Osler nodes, Roth spots, +rheumatoid factor, GN)             |
|                                                    | Micro (cultures that don’t fit the above, or serologic evidence of acute infection) |

Evaluation

- Physical exam: murmur, decreased peripheral perfusion, evidence of
    heart failure, petechiae, splinter hemorrhages, Janeway
    lesions/Osler nodes, organomegaly

- Blood cultures: at least three sets from different sites over a span
    of several hours

- Echo (TTE vs TEE)

<!-- -->

- It can be reasonable to start with TEE if pretest probability is
    high enough, if patient already has known valvular abnormalities, or
    TTE will be technically difficult

<!-- -->

- EKG: new heart block or prolonged PR raises concern for
    endocardial/perivalvular abscess. Endocarditis patients should be on
    telemetry, monitored closely by team.

- CXR: infiltrates suggestive of septic pulmonary emboli, pulmonary
    edema, cardiomegaly

- Imaging of distant affected site if concerned for septic emboli

- Other advanced imaging in select scenario: cardiac CTA, cardiac MRI,
    FDG-PET/CT

Management

- Empiric antibiotics:

<!-- -->

- If bacteria isolated from blood, reference bacteremia section for
    abx choice

- If awaiting cultures

    - Native valve: Vancomycin +/- GNR coverage (depending on clinical
        stability, risk factors, etc.)

    - Prosthetic valve: Vancomycin and cefepime, consider gentamicin

<!-- -->

- Antibiotic Duration: determined by ID, often 4-6 weeks

- Cardiac surgery consult: if valve dysfunction, perivalvular abscess,
    large (\>20mm) vegetations, heart block, ongoing embolization on
    abx, delayed Cx clearance (\>1 week on abx)

Additional Information:

- Complications:

<!-- -->

- Cardiac:

    - Heart failure: usually secondary to valve dysfunction. Most
        common when aortic valve involved, risk also depends on organism
        (worst is *Staph aureus*)

    - Perivalvular abscess: suspect when there are conduction
        abnormalities on EKG.

    - Pericarditis: can be suppurative or non-suppurative

    - Intracardiac Fistula

- Septic emboli and metastatic abscesses

- Mycotic aneurysm: usually occurs at vessel branch points

<!-- -->

- Follow Up

<!-- -->

- Repeat TTE at completion of treatment to establish new baseline

- Followed for valvular dysfunction with frequency determined by
    nature of the dysfunction

- Regular dental care; prior IE is an indication for SBE prophylaxis
    with dental work.

<!-- -->

- Episode of IE is an indication for PDA or VSD closure

Central Nervous System Infection – VASP

Bacterial Meningitis

Evaluation

- Blood cultures prior to antibiotics if possible

- Head CT pre-LP, only if: Immunocompromised, hx of CNS diseases
    (shunts, trauma, tumors), papilledema on exam or FND, AMS, or new
    onset seizure.

- If there is a delay in obtaining head CT or LP, DO NOT delay
    antibiotics.

- Lumbar puncture (See Procedures Section):

<!-- -->

- Obtain: Opening pressure, cell count + differential, glucose,
    protein, bacterial culture

- Send an extra tube or two of CSF to the lab, if possible, to be
    frozen in case extra testing is needed (Order ‘Miscellaneous test’
    and for test name put “Please freeze CSF in virology;” reference
    lab: VUMC, specimen type: CSF)

- Additional studies to consider in select pts: HSV 1, 2 PCR (NOT
    antibodies), VZV PCR, VDRL, Crypto Ag, fungal and/or AFB cultures,
    MTB PCR, West Nile Virus Ab, Enterovirus PCR, Histoplasma Ag, or
    Biofire Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel. These should not be performed
    routinely on all patients and consult ID where management questions
    exist.

- If Biofire Meningitis/Encephalitis Panel is performed, double check
    what is included to avoid sending duplicate individual tests (ie
    HSV, VZV, enterovirus, etc.) A negative cryptococcus on Biofire does
    not exclude disease (CSF Crypto Ag is more sensitive)

Management

- ANTIBIOTICS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE:

<!-- -->

- Ceftriaxone 2g IV q12h + Vancomycin, adjusted for renal function

- Piperacillin-tazobactam cannot be used due to poor CNS penetration

- IV ampicillin 2g q4h for optional coverage of Listeria for
    immunocompromised patients, pregnant women, or age \>50 (adjust
    based on renal function)

- IV acyclovir 10 mg/kg (based on adjusted body weight) q8h, if
    suspected HSV or VZV meningitis, make sure to run with adequate
    pre-hydration with NS

- Consider empiric PO/IV doxycycline 100mg BID if tick-borne illness
    is suspected

<!-- -->

- Steroids: Based on IDSA guidelines, steroids (dexamethasone 0.15
    mg/kg q6h) should be given about 10-20 minutes before the first dose
    of antibiotics, or at the same time, in patients with suspected
    bacterial meningitis. IF pneumococcus is isolated, continue IV
    steroids for 2-4 days; otherwise, can discontinue

- ID consultation: Duration should be guided by ID and varies based on
    organism recovered

Encephalitis

Background

- The presence or absence of normal brain function/cognition is the
    important distinguishing clinical feature between encephalitis and
    meningitis

Evaluation

- MRI more sensitive that CT, although imaging may or may not
    demonstrate abnormal radiographic findings in patients with
    encephalitis

- LP – similar studies as for meningitis (see above) + BioFire MEP for
    ALL pts

Management

- Acyclovir 10mg/kg IV q8hr, consideration of antibacterial therapy if
    unable to conclusively exclude a bacterial meningitis, consideration
    of doxycycline if tick-borne infection is on the differential, and
    further treatment as guided by ID

- ID consult is strongly encouraged for all patients with suspected
    encephalitis

Brain Abscess

Evaluation/Management

- Consult: Neurosurgery and ID

- Blood Cultures, HIV testing in any patient with a brain lesion

- Empiric antibiotics:

<!-- -->

- IV Vancomycin (target trough 15 - 20 mcg/mL) + ceftriaxone 2g IV
    q12h + metronidazole 500mg IV/PO q6h

- If concern for extension from otitis externa, use an antipseudomonal
    cephalosporin (cefepime 2g IV Q8h) instead of ceftriaxone

- Brain abscesses generally polymicrobial, thus broad-spectrum
    antibiotics indicated

<!-- -->

- Aminoglycosides, macrolides, tetracyclines (e.g. doxycycline),
    clindamycin, beta-lactam/beta-lactamase combinations (e.g., Zosyn)
    and 1st-generation cephalosporins (e.g., cefazolin) should NOT be
    used as they do not cross BBB at high concentration.

- Antibiotic Duration: Based on surgical drainage and Infectious
    Diseases guidance

Epidural Abscess

Management

- If spinal lesion, consult ‘Spine surgery’ and it will be directed to
    Ortho-Spine or Neurosurgery, depending on who is on call.

- Antibiotics should be started as soon as the diagnosis of epidural
    abscess is suspected, immediately following the collection of two
    sets of blood cultures

<!-- -->

- Vancomycin 15-20mg/kg IV q8-12h (adjusted for renal function) +
    ceftriaxone 2g IV q24h (or q12hr if there is secondary meningitis)

- Use cefepime 2g IV q8h instead of ceftriaxone if concern for
    *Pseudomonas*

<!-- -->

- ID consult is strongly encouraged and they will guide duration

Fungal Infections – Justin Smith

Histoplasmosis

Background

- Endemic to Ohio and Mississippi river valley

- Pulmonary infiltrate with hilar or mediastinal LAD, pulmonary
    nodule/cavitary lesion, pulmonary syndrome with erythema nodosum

- DDx: TB, malignancy, sarcoidosis (if considering sarcoidosis, rule
    out histoplasmosis as sarcoidosis treatment can induce disseminated
    histoplasmosis)

Evaluation

- Antigen (requires attending approval): For acute pulmonary
    histoplasmosis, 65% urine sensitivity, 69% serum sensitivity, and
    83% sensitivity when co-tested. Thus, both serum and urine Ag are
    usually sent together

<!-- -->

- Lower rates of positivity when disease is localized, versus diffuse
    throughout the lungs or disseminated.

- There are relatively high rates of cross-reactivity, where
    histoplasma antigen will be positive with blastomycosis; therefore,
    do not order blasto Ag if ordering histo Ag in MOST cases

<!-- -->

- Serology: Consider Histoplasma Ab if evaluating for pulmonary
    disease

- Culture: most useful in chronic infections, sensitivity is low in
    acute/localized and may take \>6 weeks to grow.

- Bronchoscopy: If clinical suspicion is high and work up negative,
    consider interventional pulmonology consult for consideration of
    bronchoscopy

Management

- Outpatient/Mild disease:

<!-- -->

- Tx not required if symptoms \<4 weeks, initiate if symptomatic
    beyond 4 weeks

- Itraconazole: 200mg TID x3 days loading, then BID (adjusted by
    levels which are drawn 2 weeks post-start) for 6-12 weeks minimum

- Can use oral formulation or capsules (capsules require high acidity,
    give with food consumption or OJ or coke; do not use capsules if
    patient is on H2 blockers/PPI)

- Voriconazole, Posaconazole: used if not tolerating itraconazole or
    as salvage therapy

<!-- -->

- Inpatient/Moderate to Severe Disease:

<!-- -->

- Amphotericin: 1-2 weeks induction, followed by PO itraconazole for
    12 weeks (total)

- Methylprednisolone: help to prevent ARDS with significant lung
    involvement

Additional Information

- Complications: Pericarditis, arthritis/arthralgias with erythema
    nodosum, chronic cavitary lesions, fibrosing mediastinitis,
    broncholithiasis

- Disseminated Histoplasmosis:

<!-- -->

- Typically found in immunocompromised populations

- Clinical presentations: FUO, weight loss, disseminated LAD,
    cutaneous manifestations, bone marrow suppression/pancytopenia,
    liver enzymes elevation, various solid organ involvement on imaging
    (liver, spleen, adrenals, nodes)

- Management

    - Mild: itraconazole

    - Moderate to Severe: amphotericin induction followed by
        itraconazole

    - CNS involvement: amphotericin for 4-6 weeks as induction

Blastomycosis

Background

- Endemic to Mississippi/Ohio river valley, southern and midwestern
    US, great lakes

- Pulmonary syndrome: cough, fever, hemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnea

<!-- -->

- Can result in both an acute or chronic pneumonia, as well as ARDS

<!-- -->

- Cutaneous: raised verrucous lesion, varying in color, with irregular
    borders

- MSK: osteolytic lesion, draining sinus, soft tissue swelling

- Multi-system: up to 20-40% of cases, most typically lung/skin
    involvement.

Evaluation

- Culture: typically takes 1-4 weeks

- Ag: urine \>serum. \~90% sensitive, but only 80% specific because of
    cross-reactivity

- Serology: available, but not very useful because of high degree of
    cross-reactivity

Management

- Mild: PO itraconazole for 6-12 months with loading, check level at 2
    weeks

- Moderate to Severe: induction with Amphotericin, followed by 6-12
    months of PO itraconazole

Candida

Background

- Oropharyngeal: white plaques in mouth, change in taste, erythema
    without plaques

<!-- -->

- Usually seen in infants, older adults, immunocompromised host (HIV
    or chemotherapy), inhaled steroid users

<!-- -->

- Esophageal: odynophagia, especially retrosternal pain (AIDS defining
    illness)

- Vulvovaginitis: itching, burning, vaginal discharge, vulvar
    erythema, vulvar edema, dyspareunia, dysuria

- Balanitis: painful white plaques with burning and itching on the
    glans penis

- Mastitis: erythema, tenderness in breast feeding woman.

Management

- Depends on specifics, but typically nystatin or fluconazole EXCEPT
    *C. glabrata* (proof of fluconazole susceptibility needed) and *C.
    krusei* (intrinsically resistant to fluconazole)

- Cx generally not indicated unless complicated pt with extensive tx
    history for Candida

Additional Information

- Disseminated disease

<!-- -->

- Presentation: Primarily immunocompromised populations (hematologic
    malignancies, solid organ transplant recipients, receiving
    chemotherapy, TPN, steroid use, broad spectrum antibiotics) and ICU
    settings (especially, burn, trauma, and neonatal)

- Diagnosis: *Candida* in a bacterial blood culture (NEVER
    contaminant)

- Start micafungin 100mg IV and consult ID for candidemia or if
    concerned for disseminated disease

HIV/AIDS and ART – Kathryn Snyder and Quinton Taylor

Background

- Why is ART important?

<!-- -->

- Clear morbidity and mortality benefits across all CD4 counts

- Decreases subsequent infections (both common and opportunistic)

- Decreased HIV related comorbid conditions, viral reservoirs, and
    transmission

<!-- -->

- New HIV Diagnosis

<!-- -->

- ID consult if patient is not on Rogers ID service (important for
    initiation, follow up \[CCC\], social work assistance)

- ART is indicated for all HIV+ patients, regardless of CD4; however,
    starting ART requires appropriate outpatient follow up

- Lab evaluation:

    - HIV viral load, genotype, and resistance testing

    - T cell subsets (CD4 Count), CBC with differential, CMP, UA

    - HLA\*B5701 testing before using abacavir containing regimen

    - QuantiFERON Gold

    - Pregnancy testing

    - Viral hepatitis serologies

    - Toxoplasma serologies

    - Other STI screening (Syphilis, Gonorrhea/Chlamydia)

<!-- -->

- Timing of ART initiation

<!-- -->

- Factors affecting timing of initiation

    - Drug toxicity and interactions, risks for resistance, adherence
        barriers

    - Treatment of opportunistic infections may delay initiation of
        ART given associated risk of immune reconstitution inflammatory
        syndrome (IRIS)

        - Delay ART for several weeks after initiation of therapy for
            cryptococcal meningitis, tuberculosis, and CMV retinitis

<!-- -->

- ART plan for overnight admits: okay to continue home ART, special
    consideration for:

<!-- -->

- Patients with hepatic or renal dysfunction may need dose adjustment

- Interactions with other newly initiated medications

- If there is concern for non-adherence, can hold morning dose

- Combination pills may need to be ordered as separate components

<!-- -->

- Common key regimens for initiation

<!-- -->

- Most regimens consist of an NRTI backbone (2 agents) plus a
    3<sup>rd</sup> agent

- Some dual therapy regimens (such as Dovato@) are non-inferior to
    standard 3-drug therapy

- Many patients are started on combination pill regimens, including
    Integrase Inhibitor based regimens: Biktarvy®, Dovato®, Triumeq®,
    Genvoya®, dolutegravir + Descovy®

AIDS Defining Clinical Conditions – Rebecca Choudhury

AIDS is defined by HIV infection with concurrent absolute CD4 count
\<200, CD4 percentage \<14%, or one of the following conditions
(predominately opportunistic infections and HIV associated
malignancies):

Neurologic/Ophthalmologic

CNS toxoplasmosis

- Presentation: Variable, depending on disease burden/location, may
    include AMS, headache, seizure, ataxia, and focal neurologic
    deficits, +/- fever and flu-like symptoms

- Evaluation: MRI w/ring-enhancing lesions on brain imaging, serum
    Toxoplasma IgG/IgM and (ideally) CSF Toxoplasma PCR (though CSF
    Toxoplasma PCR has a low sensitivity). Response to empiric therapy
    (\~90% will have radiographic improvement after 14 days) can also be
    diagnostic. Brain biopsy may be indicated if diagnostic uncertainty.

- Management: Pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin is the
    preferred regimen, discuss dosing with pharmacy. Alternative
    regimens: clindamycin, Bactrim, atovaquone

Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)

- Presentation: chronic (weeks to months), progressive neurologic
    dysfunction, particularly incoordination and other motor
    dysfunction, aphasia, sometimes cognitive impairment and personality
    changes

- Evaluation: MRI brain w/patchy areas of demyelination in the
    subcortical white matter; location is variable, but parietal,
    occipital, and cerebellar involvement are common. JC virus PCR from
    CSF. Brain biopsy.

- Management: Initiation of ART (there is no specific JC
    virus-directed therapy), IRIS may occur in which case clinical
    worsening before improvement may be seen. Fatal if HIV goes
    untreated.

HIV-related encephalopathy

- Presentation: Similar to other progressive dementias, with short
    term memory loss followed by worsening global cognitive dysfunction,
    motor deficits, sometimes seizures in late stages

- Evaluation: MRI w/diffuse cerebral atrophy and/or demyelinating
    lesions similar to PML. CSF w/elevated protein +/- lymphocytic
    pleocytosis, with no alternative cause. Send HIV RNA from the CSF,
    usually + in HIV encephalopathy

Cryptococcal meningitis

- Presentation: Subacute to chronically worsening HA and fevers;
    meningismus and photophobia may be present but are often absent;
    rarely, focal neurologic deficits

- Evaluation: LP to check opening pressure and can send serum and CSF
    Cryptococcus Ag. Brain imaging may be non-diagnostic

- Treatment: Induction therapy with amphotericin and flucytosine x14
    days (at least), with repeat LP close to end of induction to confirm
    CSF inflammation is improving and fungal culture is negative.
    Consolidation therapy consists of high dose fluconazole for at least
    8 weeks, followed by maintenance therapy with fluconazole for one
    year. Pts may require serial LP or VP shunt to manage ICP.

<!-- -->

- Delay ART for several weeks after start of treatment to avoid risk
    of IRIS.

CMV retinitis (with vision loss)

- Presentation: Blurry vision, focal blind spots, visual field
    deficits, or scotomas and floaters. Typically begins unilateral,
    though often progresses to bilateral involvement.

- Evaluation: Always consult ophtho if you suspect it! May cause
    complete retinal detachment. Check serum CMV PCR (or vitreous if
    able)

- Management: PO valgancyclovir (+intravitreous ganciclovir or
    foscarnet in severe disease). If not on ART, must delay ART for at
    least 2 weeks after start of CMV retinitis treatment to prevent
    immune recovery uveitis

Pulmonary

*Pneumocystis jirovecii* pneumonia (PJP)

- Presentation: fever, shortness of breath, cough (usually
    non-productive), sometimes night sweats and weight loss. Hypoxia out
    of proportion to exam.

- Evaluation: CT chest appearance usually bilateral and diffuse with
    GGOs and cystic lesions of varying size. Large cysts can rupture,
    causing pneumothorax.

<!-- -->

- Transbronchial biopsy, BAL, or induced sputum with cytology and GMS
    stain.

- Sputum Pneumocystis PCR can be done, but this is a send-out with
    long turn-around-time

- Consider serum LDH and 1,3-BD-glucan: should be elevated, but are
    nonspecific.

<!-- -->

- Management: Bactrim is the preferred treatment; PO is preferable as
    Bactrim is 100% bioavailable. Check ABG on ROOM AIR to consider of
    adding adjunctive steroids (If A-a gradient \>/=35mmHg and/or PaO2
    \<70mmHg). Alternative regimens may include primaquine + clindamycin
    or IV (NOT inhaled) pentamidine.

Pulmonary tuberculosis

- Presentation: With low CD4, can have upper lobe cavities but also
    atypical radiographic pattern, including a normal-appearing CXR.
    Have a high degree of suspicion in any patient with advanced HIV and
    respiratory complaints.

- Evaluation: TB skin tests and IGRAs have a high false negative rate
    in advanced HIV. At VUMC, any pt with HIV and respiratory complaints
    must be placed on airborne until TB ruleout- 3 sputum mycobacterial
    cultures collected at least 8 hours apart. If concentrated smear is
    negative x3, TB is unlikely (though have to follow up final culture
    to be sure).

- Management: RIPE therapy is the standard initial treatment, with
    adjustment if needed for drug resistance or contraindications

*Herpes simplex* tracheobronchitis and/or pneumonitis/pneumonia

- Evaluation: bronchoscopy with positive HSV PCR from BAL +/- lung
    biopsy. (Usually associated with HSV-1)

- Management: agent and duration not well defined for bronchopulmonary
    disease; depending on severity of presentation, likely IV acyclovir
    to start followed by transition to PO antiviral once evidence of
    clinical improvement, for a total of 10-14 days.

Gastrointestinal

Esophageal candidiasis

- Presentation: Dysphagia, odynophagia or both. Concurrent
    oropharyngeal candidiasis (“thrush’) is common but not universal.

- Evaluation: Typically presumptive. Treatment is the test; start
    fluconazole and consider EGD if symptoms do not improve after
    several days (in which case candidiasis may be severe, or it might
    not be the cause)

- Management: Fluconazole; nystatin is ineffective, especially in the
    severely immunocompromised

*Herpes simplex* esophagitis

- Evaluation: EGD shows diffuse ulcerations throughout the esophagus;
    in severe disease ulcers may coalesce into dark patches, “black
    esophagus.” Esophageal biopsy is definitive, but can infer based on
    EGD appearance and serum studies.

- Management: Similar to other mucocutaneous infections, consider IV
    acyclovir at first and transition to PO once clinically improved

CMV esophagitis/enteritis/colitis

- Presentation: GI bleeding (colitis) or dysphagia and odynophagia
    (esophagitis)

- Evaluation: serum CMV PCR, consult GI for consideration of
    EGD/colonoscopy

- Management: (val)ganciclovir, foscarnet if ganciclovir resistance or
    contraindication

Chronic (\>1 mo) intestinal isosporiasis

- Evaluation: Stool ova/parasite can capture Iospora belli (new name
    Cystoisospora belli), may need serial analysis due to intermittent
    shedding. Oocysts may also be seen on duodenal biopsy.

- Management: Bactrim; pyrimethamine + leucovorin if Bactrim is
    contraindicated

Chronic intestinal cryptosporidiosis

- Presentation: Diarrhea; may infect respiratory tract, causing
    nonproductive cough

- Evaluation: on GiPP or Cryptosporidium Ag

- Management: Early initiation or optimization of ART; Monotherapy
    with nitazoxanide is preferred; raising CD4 count \>100 is necessary
    to cure infection

Recurrent *Salmonella* septicemia

- Generally sensitive to fluoroquinolones, but if not clinically
    improving as expected you can request sensitivities from the
    microbiology lab.

Neoplastic

Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma

- DLBCL, Burkitt’s, immunoblastic (subset of DLBCL), primary effusion
    lymphoma, and 1º CNS

Kaposi’s sarcoma

- Presentation: Distinctive mucocutaneous lesions, usually raised,
    papular, violaceous or darkly colored, non-tender and non-pruritic.
    Can also involve the visceral organs (esp lungs and GI tract) and
    deep lymphatic system.

- Evaluation: clinical, tissue biopsy for staging, HHV-8 serum PCR.

- Management: Limited mucocutaneous disease may resolve with
    initiation/optimization of ART, but widespread or resistant disease
    may require additional local therapies (eg: radiation) or systemic
    chemo

- Bacillary angiomatosis (caused by Bartonella) may present similarly,
    but can be distinguished from KS on biopsy. It is neither a cancer
    nor an AIDS defining clinical condition, and is usually treated with
    doxycycline.

Cervical cancer

- Presentation, diagnosis, and treatment are essentially the same as
    in HIV-negative patients, but incidence is higher and disease
    progression is often more rapid

Multisystem/Miscellaneous

Extrapulmonary or disseminated Mycobacterial infection (TB and non-TB)

- TB can go everywhere; some notable extrapulmonary sites include
    lymph nodes (e.g., scrofula), bones and joints (e.g., Pott’s disease
    of the spine), pleura and pericardium, GU tract, and CNS. Dx can
    come from tissue culture and sometimes MTB PCR for more rapid
    detection (needs ID approval).

- TB-IRIS may be severe (esp with high infection burden) and hard to
    distinguish from TB treatment failure; can also be seen in
    adequately treated TB (provoked by the presence of dead bacteria)
    and undiagnosed latent TB.

- Disseminated MAC is usually diagnosed with AFB blood culture (only 1
    positive needed). Think about it in patients with uncontrolled HIV
    and severe immunosuppression (esp CD4 \<50), with unintentional
    weight loss, chronic diarrhea and/or dyspnea, and evidence of GI
    malabsorption or with bone marrow suppression

Extrapulmonary or disseminated Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcocosis, and
Coccidiodomycosis

- Can be difficult to distinguish based on clinical presentation and
    imaging alone. Diagnosed by culture and/or antigen testing depending
    on the organism and site of infection, and diagnosis may be
    supported by serologic studies.

- Initial treatment of choice: liposomal amphotericin B in almost all
    cases

Chronic mucocutaneous HSV

- Defined as mucocutaneous lesions present for \>1 month, can be
    present at any site

    Multicentric Castleman’s Disease

- See “Plasma Cell Dyscrasias” section in Hematology/Oncology for more
    details

NRTI Additional Information

- Tenofovir alone is indicated for HBV, in which case you should be
    mindful of renal clearance when dosing. In HIV, it is only used in
    combination with emtricitabine and third agent. Contraindicated if
    CrCl\<30

- Class-wide side effect: Lactic acidosis, steatosis and lipoatrophy
    (though very rare with contemporary NRTIs)

- Resistance: M184V confers high resistance to emtricitabine and
    lamivudine, mid-level resistance to abacavir, hypersusceptibility to
    tenofovir

Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) – Terra Swanson

Background:

- Definition based on 2012 KDIGO Guidelines: 

<!-- -->

- Rise in serum creatinine (sCr) \> 0.3 mg/dL within 48 hours, or
    increase \> 1.5 x baseline in 7 days  

- Urine volume \<0.5 cc/Kg/H for at least 6 H

 Framework for AKI 

- Pre-renal/hemodynamic AKI:  

<!-- -->

- Volume depletion: GI losses, hemorrhage, burns, critical illness
    increased insensible losses 

- Decreased effective circulating volume: cardiorenal, hepatorenal,
    hemodynamic effects of ACEi/ARB 

- Afferent arteriole constriction \[NSAIDs, Iodinated contrast\] 

- Renal vein thrombus 

<!-- -->

- Intra-renal: Glomerular, tubular, or interstitial diseases

<!-- -->

- ATN = Most common form of intrinsic AKI. Can be Ischemic or toxic

    - Toxins can be broken down further into endogenous (e.g. rhabdo)
        and exogenous (e.g. drugs)

- Acute Interstitial Nephritis (AIN): Usually drug induced (NSAIDs,
    PPIs, beta lactam abx)  

- Glomerulonephritis

- Other causes:  

    - Crystalline nephropathy: IV acyclovir, tumor lysis, ethylene
        glycol 

    - Small vessel disease: MAHA, TTP, HUS

    - Large vessel disease: Aortic dissection, renal artery stenosis  

<!-- -->

- Post-renal: Can occur at any level of the GU system 

<!-- -->

- Ureteral: stones, external compression (malignancy, LAD, abscess) 

- Bladder: neurogenic bladder, malignancy, obstructing blood clot 

- Urethra: BPH, prostate cancer, prostatitis  

<!-- -->

- Pre-renal azotemia and acute tubular necrosis comprise the majority
    of inpatient acute kidney injuries

Evaluation 

- History and volume exam

- Labs: CMP, urinalysis, protein/Cr ratio

- 500cc-1L IV fluid challenge: If sCr improves to baseline in \<48H
    then the insult was likely pre-renal. If not, then look for other
    etiologies

- Evaluate for obstruction: I/O cath, Foley, Post Void Residual \>250
    cc

- Who needs a renal ultrasound? 

<!-- -->

- No obvious cause of AKI

- Abrupt oliguria or anuria (think renal vein thrombus or obstruction)

- High suspicion for bladder outlet obstruction (PVRs might give you
    same data) 

- Add doppler to evaluate for renal artery stenosis (or if working up
    resistant hypertension) 

<!-- -->

- Urine Electrolytes 

<!-- -->

- FENa \<1% or FEUrea \<33% (if on diuretics) suggest pre-renal
    physiology

    - Caveat, only validated in *oliguric* patients and more difficult
        to interpret after fluids, diuretics, etc

    - Not needed in the initial work-up of all patients with AKI. If
        high suspicion for pre-renal etiology, trial fluid challenge and
        assess response first

- Urine sodium can be used to assess Na avidity: UNa \> 40 suggests
    ATN and UNa \< 20 suggests pre-renal

Management

- All causes

<!-- -->

- Minimize fluctuations in blood pressure

- Consider holding anti-hypertensive medications, especially ACEi/ARB
    (remember to determine plan to resume at/after discharge)

- Avoid unnecessary nephrotoxins

- Dose-adjust medications for changing renal function

<!-- -->

- Pre-Renal

<!-- -->

- True volume depletion- Intravenous volume expansion

- Cardiorenal syndrome- Decongestion/diuresis

- Hepatorenal syndrome- See Hepatology section for more information

<!-- -->

- Post-renal

<!-- -->

- Relieve Obstruction: I/O cath, foley, Urostomy (Urology),
    percutaneous nephrostomy (IR)

- Monitor for post-obstructive diuresis

<!-- -->

- Intra-renal

<!-- -->

- ATN- supportive care, monitor for post-ATN diuresis. If delayed
    recovery, may need outpatient dialysis

- Glomerulonephritis- Consult AKI service for assistance with biopsy
    and selecting immunosuppressive agents if needed

- AIN- Review meds, consult nephrology for possible biopsy and
    recommendations for steroids

<!-- -->

- Monitor for renal recovery 

<!-- -->

- Suspect concomitant ATN if sCr declines with volume expansion,
    diuresis, or relief of obstruction but remains a few points above
    baseline

<!-- -->

- When to consult Nephrology

<!-- -->

- Urgent indication for dialysis (see “Renal Replacement Therapy”)

- Abrupt anuria

- Cr worsening or urine output inadequate w/o clear cause

- Need for kidney biopsy  

Additional Information 

- Rhabdomyolysis: UA positive for blood but no RBCs on microscopy

<!-- -->

- Toxic damage due to myoglobin

- Serologic markers of muscle injury: elevated CK, AST\>AST with
    normal ALK Phos 

- Fluids adjusted to urine output goal of 200-300 mL/hr until CK
    declines

    - Consider isotonic bicarb for initial 1-2L of IVF urine
        alkalinization to reduce precipitation

- Avoid calcium repletion for hypocalcemia unless symptomatic 

<!-- -->

- Post-obstructive diuresis 

<!-- -->

- Necessary process to clear accumulated uremic toxins

- Replace \~50% of urine output to prevent pre-renal azotemia

- Monitor calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium in severe
    post-obstructive diuresis

Contrast Induced AKI (CI-AKI) – Trey Richardson

Background

- When someone develops an AKI do your due diligence and evaluate for
    the usual causes of AKI, regardless of when they were given contrast

- Mechanism of injury: direct toxic effect leading to tubular necrosis
    and arteriolar vasoconstriction leading to medullary ischemia

KDIGO Criteria for CI-AKI:

- sCr increase by 0.5mg/dl or 25% increase in sCr from baseline 48 H
    after radiologic procedure where intravenous contrast was
    administered

Who is at risk for CI-AKI?

- Normal kidney function: incidence of CI-AKI is 1-3%

- Pre-existing CKD: Incidence of CI-AKI may be as high as 20% in
    patients with CKD 4-5

- Other risk factors include: diabetes, heart failure, and advanced
    age

- No real sCr or eGFR threshold below which iodinated contrast is
    contraindicated, especially in patients for whom imaging will alter
    management (e.g. acute stroke, PE, STEMI)

Risk reduction strategies

- Volume expansion with isotonic crystalloid (PRESERVE Trial) in
    patients with AKI or eGFR \<30 ml/min/1.73m^2 who are clinically
    hypo or euvolemic

<!-- -->

- 1cc/kg/hr for 6-12 hours before/during and 6-12 hours after the
    procedure in patients at high risk for CI-AKI. This rate can be
    decreased based on the risk for hypervolemia

<!-- -->

- If the patient is volume overloaded, they probably should not
    receive volume expansion prior to a contrasted study

- Never delay a necessary procedure out of concern for worsening renal
    function. If in doubt, talk to nephrology

Iodinated contrast in CKD-5/ESRD patients

- Iodinated contrast does not need to be dialyzed immediately

- Avoid giving if you are trying to preserve residual kidney function
    in ESRD on PD

Gadolinium contrast for MRI

- Contraindicated in any AKI or if GFR \<30 in CKD given risk of
    nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.

Approach to Chronic Kidney Disease – Terra Swanson

Definition of CKD

- Decreased kidney function or one or more markers of kidney damage
    for 3 or more months

- History of kidney transplant

- GFR \< 60; Staging helps risk-stratify pts likely to progress or
    develop complications of CKD

<!-- -->

- CKD IIIa: eGFR 45-60

- CKD IIIb: eGFR 30-44

- CKD IV: eGFR 15-30

- CKD V: eGFR \< 15

<!-- -->

- Markers of kidney damage

<!-- -->

- Albumin/Cr ratio

    - Mild: 0-30 mg/g

    - Moderate: 30-300 mg/g

    - Severe: \>300 mg/g

- Urine sediment: RBC casts, WBC casts, oval fat bodies or fatty
    casts, granular casts

- Electrolyte derangements

- Abnormalities on histology

- Structural abnormalities: (cysts, hydronephrosis, scarring, masses,
    renal artery stenosis)

When to refer to nephrology clinic

- eGFR \< 45

- Persistent urine albumin/creatinine ratio \> 300 mg/g

- Urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 500 mg/g

- Rapid loss of kidney function (\> 30% decline over 4 months)

- Hematuria not 2/2 urologic condition or if there are RBC casts on UA

- Inability to identify presumed cause of renal dysfunction

- Difficult to manage complications (hyperkalemia, anemia,
    bone-mineral disease, HTN)

- Confirmed or presumed hereditary kidney disease (PCKD suspected)

Complications of CKD

Imbalance of water homeostasis

- As renal mass declines the ability to both concentrate and dilute
    the urine is impaired

- This manifests as hyponatremia (no end-organ to respond to ADH) and
    edema

- Treat this with water restriction, diuretics or, eventually,
    ultrafiltration

Metabolic acidosis

- Correcting serum bicarbonate to a goal of 23-30 meq/L slows decline
    in renal function and protects against bone-mineral complications of
    chronic metabolic acidosis

- Can calculate bicarbonate deficit to estimate dose of bicarbonate

- If bicarb \< 22, consider:

<!-- -->

- Sodium bicarb 650 mg TID (8mEq bicarb per 650mg tablet) up to
    5850mg/day (70 mEq or 3 tabs TID)

- Sodium citrate (Bicitra): 1mL = 1 mEq \* Careful in cirrhosis since
    citrate cannot be metabolized

- Baking soda (sodium bicarbonate): 1 teaspoon = 59 mEq HCO3 (careful
    of Na load)

HTN in CKD

- Goal BP \< 120/80 (Class 2B recommendation) based on SPRINT trial,
    ACC/AHA 2017, and KDIGO 2021 guidelines

- All comers: Diet (e.g. DASH) and lifestyle modifications

- CKD without albuminuria or DM:

<!-- -->

- Start pharmacotherapy based on ASCVD risk as well as risk for other
    target organ damage

<!-- -->

- CKD with moderate to severe albuminuria w/ or w/out DM

<!-- -->

- ACEi or ARB titrated to maximally tolerated dose (Class 1B
    recommendation)

- Thiazide-like diuretics (see CLICK trial for chlorthalidone in
    advanced CKD)

- Loop diuretics can assist with volume driven HTN in patients with
    CKD 4-5

<!-- -->

- HTN in kidney transplant

<!-- -->

- CCBs or ARBs are first line (Class 1C recommendation)

<!-- -->

- Consider stopping ACE-i/ARB if:

<!-- -->

- GFR declines \>30% over 4 months. Consider evaluation for renal
    artery stenosis

- K \> 5.5 despite low K diet, optimizing dose of diuretics, or adding
    K-binders

Anemia in CKD

- Multifactorial: decreased EPO production, impaired iron absorption,
    uremic toxins suppressing bone marrow, loss of blood in dialysis
    circuit, and from GI AVMs

- Indications for iron supplementation in non-dialysis patients:

<!-- -->

- ALL patients with TSAT \<20% and ferritin \<100 ng/mL

- Patients with Hb \<13 and TSAT \<30% and ferritin \<500 ng/mL

    - Can start with PO supplementation (see Anemia section). Reassess
        iron levels in 1-3 mos; if not appropriately ↑, consider IV iron
        repletion

<!-- -->

- Dialysis patients:

<!-- -->

- IV Iron preferred method of repletion for HD patients with

    - TSAT \< 20% and ferritin \< 200

    - TSAT \<30% and ferritin \<500 AND with Hb \< 10 OR are on EPO

- Dosing: usually administered at HD sessions

    - 125 mg ferric gluconate at consecutive HD sessions x 8 doses

    - 100 mg iron sucrose at consecutive HD sessions x 10 doses

    - Ferumoxytol 510mg at the end of two HD sessions 1-4 weeks apart

- Indications for EPO

    - Pts w/ Hb \<10 who are not iron deficient (ferritin \>500) or
        who’s anemia persists despite adequate iron repletion

Hyperkalemia (Goal K \< 5.5)

- Patients with diabetic nephropathy (T4 RTA) and CKD 5-ESRD are at
    the highest risk

- Strategies to mitigate hyperK

<!-- -->

- Low K diet (\< 40-70 mEq/day or 1500-2700 mg/day)

- Loop diuretics

- GI cation exchangers

    - Patiromer (Veltassa): binds K in colon in exchange for calcium

    - Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (Lokelma): binds K throughout
        intestine in exchange for sodium and H+

    - Do not use Kayexelate as chronic therapy

- Treat metabolic acidosis

Mineral bone disease in ESRD

- Avoid calcium supplementation in mild or asymptomatic hypocalcemia

- Replace vitamin D to \>20 (weak evidence)

- Phos goal \< 5.5

<!-- -->

- Sevelamer: use lowest dose effective to achieve Phos \< 5.5

    - Phos 5.5-7.5: initial dose 800 TID with meals

    - Phos 7.5-9.0: initial dose 1200-1600 TID with meals

    - Phos \> 9: initial dose 1600 TID

    - Can titrate dosing by 400 to 800 mg per meal at 2-week intervals

- Restrict dietary phos to 900 mg/day

<!-- -->

- PTH goal in CKD3: 2x ULN

- PTH Goal in ESRD: 2-10x ULN

Diabetes in CKD

- Individualize A1C goals. Both the ADA and VA-DOD have guidelines for
    selecting A1C targets

- Treatment:

<!-- -->

- Metformin remains first-line but should be dose-reduced based on
    eGFR

    - eGFR \> 45: Maximum daily dose of 2000mg/day (1000mg bid)

    - eGFR \< 45: Reduce max daily dose to 1000mg/day (500mg bid)

    - eGFR \< 30: Discontinue if high risk for volume mediated
        AKI/chronically ill

- SGLT-2 inhibitors for patients with eGFR \> 30 reduces progression
    to ESRD and death from renal or cardiovascular causes (Evidence:
    DAPA-CKD, CREEDENCE)

- Finerenone (non-steroidal MRA)- would ask nephrology for help if
    considering this option since relatively new and increased risk for
    hyperkalemia. (Evidence: FIDELIO)

Dialysis initiation

- Early (CKD3a or 3b) referral to nephrology has better outcomes

- Uremic symptoms: fatigue, sleep disturbance, N/V, decreased
    appetite, dysgeusia, itching, hiccupping

- Refractory hyper K

- Refractory hypertension

- Plot your patient’s eGFR using the graph function in EPIC or CPRS to
    determine trajectory (normal age-related decline after age 60 is \~
    1ml/min/m2)

Renal Replacement Therapy (RRT) Basics – Daniel Motta

Background/Terminology

- **Dialysis** (diffusive clearance)- solutes diffuse down
    concentration gradients through a semipermeable membrane separating
    blood and dialysate

- **Dialysate** (dialysis bath)- electrolyte solution used to create
    concentration gradient for dialysis. Customizable to treat specific
    electrolyte and acid-base derangements

- **Effluent**- Fluid removed during dialysis or ultrafiltration

- **Ultrafiltration-** Hydrostatic pressure “pushing” water through a
    membrane. There is no dialysate solution used during
    ultrafiltration. Solutes are removed through the process of solvent
    drag. The effluent in this case is isotonic to plasma

- **Total ultrafiltration (UF)** - overall ultrafiltration volume
    produced during treatment

- **UF net** - net ultrafiltrate volume removed from the patient by
    the machine. The overall volume can be completely replaced (net
    even), partially replaced, or not replaced at all. UF net is the
    difference between UF and the volume replaced in the circuit

- **Timing of dialysis**- There are several studies in this space
    (IDEAL, IDEAL-ICU, AKIKI, STARRT, ELAINE). In both the outpatient
    and the inpatient setting, there is no compelling evidence that
    early start dialysis improves mortality compared to later starts

Outpatient Modalities

- Intermittent hemodialysis (iHD)

- In home hemodialysis

- Peritoneal dialysis

If someone with ESRD is admitted:

- Urgent ESRD consult if acute need, otherwise can consult them
    routinely

- Routine orders include MWF phos checks and a renal diet

- For peritoneal dialysis pts, their diet can be more liberal and
    include low phos only or even regular diet (Can just ask what diet
    he/she follows at home)

Acute Setting

- Indications: AKI leading to life-threatening changes in fluid,
    electrolyte, and acid-base balance or toxic ingestion \[AEIOU\]

<!-- -->

- Acidosis: Severe metabolic acidosis (serum pH\<7.1) refractory to
    correcting volume status or other electrolyte derangements

- Electrolytes: Severe hyperkalemia \>6.5 despite medical management
    (e.g. loop diuretics, IV fluids, GI cation exchangers, correcting
    acidemia, etc.)

- Intoxication: Dialyzable toxins and medications

    - Alcohols: ethylene glycol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol,
        diethylene glycol, and propylene glycol

    - Medications: lithium, salicylates, valproic acid, phenytoin,
        barbiturates, carbamazepine, vancomycin, aminoglycosides, etc.

- Overload: Severe fluid overload (e.g., pulmonary edema) refractory
    to diuretics

- Uremia: Uremic complications: encephalopathy, pericarditis, platelet
    dysfunction

<!-- -->

- Can perform furosemide stress test to help predict who is likely to
    recover their kidney function

<!-- -->

- If Lasix naïve, administer 1mg/kg as a bolus. If on a loop diuretic,
    administer 1.5 mg/kg as a bolus

- If within the hour they have made 200 cc of urine, then they are
    likely to regain kidney function

<!-- -->

- Modalities

<!-- -->

- iHD: Ideal for removal of toxins (e.g. alcohols, dialyzable meds).
    Use with caution in hypotensive patients

- CRRT: Set a rate of volume removal (typically 0-200 cc/hr) less
    rapid fluid/electrolytes shifts better tolerated in patients with
    hemodynamic instability

    - Anti-coagulation options- to prevent clotting of circuit

        - None

        - Heparin (preferred). Can be either within the circuit or
            systemic if indicated for another reason (e.g. DVT/PE).

        - Citrate (need to monitor calcium frequently)

    - Complications of CRRT: Infections, hypophosphatemia

<!-- -->

- Access

<!-- -->

- Dialysis catheter (aka: Vascath)

    - Non-tunneled catheter (Trialysis) used for acute dialysis

    - Different lengths depending on site (see procedures section)

- Tunneled dialysis catheter (ex: Permcath)

    - Typically used as a bridge to fistula/graft placement

    - Placed by IR

Peritoneal Dialysis Peritonitis

Background

- Typically occurs due to contamination with pathogenic skin bacteria
    during exchanges or due to exit-site/tunnel infection

- Usually presents with cloudy effluent fluid and abdominal pain. Can
    also be asymptomatic

- Important history to obtain: recent contamination, accidental
    disconnection, endoscopic or gynecologic procedure, as well as the
    presence of constipation or diarrhea

- Definitive diagnosis requires 2 of the following:

<!-- -->

- Clinical features consistent with peritonitis

- Positive dialysis effluent culture

- Dialysis effluent with WBC \> 100 with PMN \> 50%

    - Even if WBC count \< 100, presence of \> 50% PMNs is still
        strong evidence of peritonitis in pts with rapid cycle PD

Evaluation

- Examine catheter exit site

- Culture peritoneal fluid (requires specific technique, done by
    nephrology)

- Peritoneal cell count with diff, gram stain and culture

- Obtain peripheral blood cultures if there is concern for sepsis

Management

- All PD orders, intraperitoneal antibiotics, and prescription
    adjustments should be directed by ESRD consult service (page them
    overnight if concerns)

- Treatment with intraperitoneal antibiotics should be started
    immediately after specimens have been obtained if there is high
    clinical suspicion

- Empiric antibiotics regimen should cover both gram-positive and
    gram-negative organisms, typically with vancomycin and third
    generation Cephalosporin

- Systemic antibiotics are generally not necessary unless pts have
    systemic signs of sepsis

- Pts with relapsing, recurrent or repeat peritonitis will likely need
    catheter removal

Secondary prevention

- Treatment with intraperitoneal OR IV antibiotics (for any infection
    requiring \> 1 dose of antibiotics) requires prophylaxis for fungal
    peritonitis with either:

<!-- -->

- Nystatin 400,000 to 500,000 units orally TID

- Fluconazole 200 mg every other day or 100 mg qdaily

<!-- -->

- Dialysate should be drained the day of endoscopies or gynecological
    procedures

Intravenous Fluids – Chandler Montgomery

Indications for intravenous fluid

- Restoration or maintenance of tissue perfusion

- Correction of electrolyte abnormalities

- Nutritional supplementation in those without reliable enteric access

Categorized into crystalloids and colloids

- Crystalloid = water + electrolytes

- Colloid = water + proteins/large molecules

Terms

- Osmolarity: osmoles of solute per L of solution

- Tonicity: ability to induce movement of water across a membrane

- Buffer: anions such as lactate, acetate, gluconate which are
    metabolized to bicarbonate in vivo with the goal of sustaining
    normal plasma pH

Crystalloids

- Isotonic fluids used for volume resuscitation

<!-- -->

- After \~ 30 mins, redistribute such that only 25% remains w/in
    intravascular space

<!-- -->

- Balanced solutions (ex: Lactated Ringer’s, Plasma-Lyte)= have
    electrolytes concentrations similar to plasma

<!-- -->

- NS may lead to renal vasoconstriction, AKI, hemodynamic instability,
    increased mortality

    - SMART and SALT-ED: balanced solutions had lower rates of death,
        new renal replacement therapy, or persistent renal dysfunction
        compared to NS

- Situations where NS may be preferred:

    - Cerebral edema/traumatic brain injury

    - Hypovolemic hyponatremia

    - Pre-existing hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis (e.g. after
        vomiting or over diuresis)

- Notes on LR

    - The small amount of K in LR (\~4 mEq/L) is unlikely to
        significantly exacerbate hyperkalemia

    - Lactate in LR is sodium lactate. No hydrogen ions are being
        added to plasma

- 5% - Used after plasma exchange

- 25% - raises oncotic pressure and restore intravascular volume

    - Uses: Post-LVP, diagnosis and treatment of hepatorenal syndrome,
        SBP (see Hepatology)

    - Evidence base for use outside of above indications is poor (SAFE
        trial)

<!-- -->

- Blood Products: Packed RBCs, FFP, cryoprecipitate, etc

Acid-Base – Ned Hardison and Trey Richardson

Background

- Abnormal serum H+ concentrations lead to impaired cellular function
    (cardiac arrest, vasodilation, decreased response to
    catecholamines), electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hypo- and
    hyperkalemia, hypo- and hypercalcemia), impaired glucose metabolism,
    impaired drug metabolism, and a whole host of other complications
    that translate to increased morbidity and mortality

- ABG/VBG reference ranges:

<!-- -->

- pH = 7.36-7.44 (\~7.32-7.40)

- PCO2 = 36-44 mmHg

- pO2: 60-100 mmHg

- HCO3 = 22-26 mEq/L

<!-- -->

- Useful formulas

<!-- -->

- pH on ABG = VBG pH + 0.035

- Anion Gap= Na-(Cl+Bicarb)

- Normal Anion Gap= 12-14

- Calculated Osmolarity= 2\[Na\]+ (\[Glucose\]/18) + (\[BUN\]/2.8)

- Osmolar gap= Measured osmolarity – Calculated osmolarity

- Winter’s formula for respiratory compensation for AGMA: expected
    pCO2 = 1.5 (serum bicarb) +8 +/- 2

    - Shortcut: Expected
        *p**C**O*<sub>2</sub> ≈ *l**a**s**t* *t**w**o* *d**i**g**i**t**s* *o**f* *p**H*

General Approach to Acid-Base Derangements

- Step 1: Determine if the patient is acidemic or alkalemic (look at
    the pH)

- Step 2: Determine the primary disorder (metabolic or respiratory)

- Step 3: Calculate anion gap (see section below)

- Step 4: Is there appropriate compensation?

- Step 5: Evaluate for secondary disorders

Anion Gap Metabolic Acidosis

Background

- Na+ is the predominant cation in normal plasma. Cl- and HCO3- are
    the predominant anions. There are anions that are not directly
    measured (e.g. most binding globulins, immunoglobulins, clotting
    factors, and other proteins). These unmeasured anions are
    responsible for the normal anion gap of \~12 meq/L. When there are
    extra unmeasured anions within the plasma, the anion gap increases

Differential

- GOLDMARK: Glycols, oxyproline (acetaminophen metabolite), L-lactate,
    D-lactate, methanol, ASA, renal failure/uremia, ketoacids

    Evaluate for secondary disorders

- Corrected bicarbonate

<!-- -->

- Corrected *H**C**O*<sub>3</sub> = patient’s *H**C**O*<sub>3</sub> +
    (patient’s anion gap - 12)

    - Corrected *H**C**O*<sub>3</sub> \> 26, coexisting metabolic
        alkalosis,

    - Corrected HCO3 \<22 coexisting non-AG metabolic acidosis

Osmolar Gap

- If there is an anion gap, it is worthwhile to always calculate an
    osmolar gap. You will be surprised the number of toxic ingestions
    you catch this way

Non-anion gap metabolic acidosis (NAGMA)

- There are two places from which people can waste bicarbonate- the
    kidneys and the gut

<!-- -->

- The urine anion-gap, which corresponds to unmeasured urinary NH4+
    (primary means of renal acid excretion), can differentiate between
    the two

- Urine anion gap = Unmeasured cations (NH4+) – unmeasured anions =
    U­Na + UK – UCl

    - Positive value-\> low NH4+-\> renal losses

        - RTA

        - Carbonic anhydrase inhibition: acetazolamide, topiramate

        - Adrenal insufficiency

        - Normal saline infusion

    - Ne-***GUT***-ive value-\>high NH4+-\>kidneys working
        appropriately-\> GI losses

        - Diarrhea

        - Pancreatic fistula

        - Ureterosigmoidostomy

<!-- -->

- Caveat: Proximal RTA has a normal distal urine acidification and has
    a negative urine AG

Managing Metabolic Acidosis

- Lactic acidosis is the most common cause of anion gap metabolic
    acidosis that we encounter

- In general, avoid use of bicarbonate to treat lactic acidosis

<!-- -->

- Remember: H<sup>+</sup> + HCO3<sup>-</sup> \<-\> H2CO3 \<-\> H2O +
    CO2. While administering bicarbonate will transiently improve pH,
    carbonic acid will eventually form and ultimately worsen acidemia

<!-- -->

- In acute NAGMA, reasonable to give bicarbonate when bicarb \<12 or
    pH \<7.1-7.2

<!-- -->

- Pay close attention to other electrolyte levels, especially
    potassium as it shifts back into cells

Metabolic Alkalosis

Background

- Metabolic alkalosis occurs as a primary disorder or as compensation
    for respiratory acidosis. A thorough history and exam can usually
    clarify which of these two scenarios is occurring

- In order for metabolic alkalosis to occur, there has to be both an
    inciting phase (e.g. volume depletion) and a maintenance phase (e.g.
    hypochloremia or hypokalemia)

Presentation

- Most symptoms of metabolic alkalosis (confusion, nausea, vomiting,
    tremors) occur as a result of other electrolyte abnormalities
    (hypocalcemia, hypokalemia)

- Serum pH of \>7.55 is likely the threshold where symptoms will
    develop

Causes

- Saline responsive (e.g. hypochloremia)

<!-- -->

- True volume depletion

- NG suction/Nausea/vomiting

- Diuretic use

<!-- -->

- Saline refractory

<!-- -->

- Hypokalemia

- Milk-Alkali syndrome

- Mineralocorticoid excess states

- Bartters Syndrome

- Gitelman’s Syndrome

Treatment

- Saline Responsive/Hypochloremia

<!-- -->

- If volume deplete, then normal saline is treatment of choice

- If alkalosis develops in setting of diuresis, then make sure
    replacing KCl and consider acetazolamide

<!-- -->

- Saline refractory

<!-- -->

- Hypokalemia- replenish potassium stores

- Hyperaldosteronism- covered in more detail in the endocrinology
    section

- Bartter syndrome and Gitelman syndrome - replace electrolytes and
    refer to nephrology

Electrolytes

Hypercalcemia – Rebecca Choudhry and Trevor Stevens

Background

- Total serum Calcium \>10.5

- Most (99%) Ca+2 is anhydrous and stored in bone. The remaining 1% is
    60% bound (mostly to albumin), and 40% ionized and able to exert a
    physiologic effect

- Remember, there is an inverse relationship between pH and Ca2+. As
    pH declines, serum Ca increases due to H+ binding to albumin and
    releasing Ca2+

- Don’t forget to correct calcium level if hypoalbuminemia (or check
    ionized calcium level),

<!-- -->

- Corrected Ca2+ = ((Normal albumin – Patient’s albumin) x 0.8)) +
    Patient’s Ca2+

    - This equation Is less reliable at very low albumin

Presentation

- Ca+2 \> 12 can cause shortened QT interval, 2nd and 3rd degree heart
    block, ventricular arrhythmias, and ST elevations mimicking MI

- Severe manifestations uncommon at Ca+2 \<14

- “Stones, bones, thrones, belly groans, and psychiatric overtones”

<!-- -->

- Bone pain

- Polydipsia/polyuria- due to nephrogenic DI

- Nausea/constipation

- Depressed mood/cognitive impairment

- Decreased level of consciousness

Evaluation

- Measure PTH

<!-- -->

- Normal or ↑ PTH

    - Primary hyperparathyroidism: ↑ Ca+2 and ↓ PO4-3

    - Tertiary hyperparathyroidism (autologous secretion of PTH in
        CKD/ESRD)

    - Familial hypercalciuric hypercalcemia (often asymptomatic, no
        treatment required).

    - Li toxicity

- ↓ PTH

    - Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (PTHrP)

    - Malignancy (boney metastases)

    - Excess vitamin D intake

    - Granulomatous disease: 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D, 25
        hydroxyvitamin D, or ACE level

    - Milk-alkali syndrome

    - Medications (classically HCTZ)

    - Thyrotoxicosis

    - Adrenal insufficiency

Management

- If Ca+2 \< 12 and asymptomatic

<!-- -->

- Encourage PO hydration

- Normal saline if hypovolemic

- Evaluate for underlying cause

<!-- -->

- If Ca+2 \> 12 with symptoms or Ca \> 14

<!-- -->

- Trend Ca q8 hrs, EKG, monitor on telemetry; strict I/Os +/- foley
    catheter

- Volume expansion w/ NS bolus followed by continuous infusion at \~
    200cc/hr

    - Goal UOP 100-150cc/hr

- Add loop diuretic (Lasix) once patient is volume expanded

- Bisphosphonates

    - Zoledronic acid 4mg IV (EGFR \>60), Pamidronate 90mg IV (EGFR
        15-60)

<!-- -->

- If Ca+2 \>14 or neurologic symptoms, consider subq (not intranasal)
    calcitonin

    - VUMC: requires approval from an oncology or endocrine attending

    - Tachyphylaxis after \~48H

- Additional Information

<!-- -->

- In CHF pt, consider early addition of a loop diuretic, especially if
    volume overloaded

- In ESRD pt with hypercalcemia (rare), patient with oliguric AKI not
    responsive to IVF, or pt with severely elevated Ca 16-18, consult
    endocrine and nephrology early

- In pts with sarcoidosis or lymphoma, consider glucocorticoids

Hypocalcemia – Trey Richardson

Background

- Can be divided into low parathyroid hormone and high parathyroid
    hormone states

<!-- -->

- Low PTH

    - Magnesium deficiency

    - Post-operative for parathyroidectomy

    - DiGeorge syndrome

    - Medications: Bisphosphonates, denosumab, aminoglycosides,
        gadolinium

    - Acidemia (Serum Ca is inversely proportional to pH)

    - Infiltrative disease: sarcoid, hemochromatosis, malignancies

    - Autoimmune hypoparathyroidism

    - CRRT (if using regional citrate anticoagulation)

- High PTH

    - Late-stage CKD

    - Hyperphosphatemia

    - Vitamin D deficiency

    - Pseudohypoparathyroidism/Parathyroid resistance

    - Consumption/deposition: Pancreatitis, rhabdomyolysis, some
        osteoblastic metastases

    - Sepsis or critical illness

Presentation

- Chvostek and Trousseau’s signs , laryngospasm, seizures, widened QRS
    and arrhythmias

- Hemodynamic instability

Evaluation

- Check PTH, albumin, iCal, VBG, Vitamin D

- Review medications for possible offenders

Management

- Under most circumstances there is no need to replace calcium.
    Instead, focus on correcting the underlying perturbation (e.g.
    acidemia, hypomagnesemia, treating pancreatitis, etc. )

- If hemodynamic instability, cardiac electrical instability, seizures
    then aggressive intravenous replacement is warranted.

<!-- -->

- Also consider preemptive repletion for patients requiring
    high-volume of blood transfusions (citrate in blood products can
    cause hypocalcemia)

- 1 g of CaCl is equivalent to 3 grams of Ca Gluconate

<!-- -->

- Avoid treatment in hyperphosphatemia, advanced CKD/ESRD, and
    rhabdomyolysis

Hypernatremia – Lauren Chan

Overview of dysnatremias

- Fluctuations in serum Na reflect fluctuations in plasma free water

- Sodium is the major driver of tonicity. The clinical signs and
    symptoms of serum Na fluctuations are related to changes in tonicity
    with most profound effects on cerebral tissue

- Two major mechanisms maintain plasma osmolarity between 275 and 290:
    Thirst and secretion of ADH. When these mechanisms malfunction,
    dysnatremias occur

Background

- Definition: Na+ \>145

- Hypernatremia = decreased free water

- Almost always due to inadequate free water intake (ICU patients,
    dementia, limited mobility, tube feeding/TPN, impaired
    thirst/adipsia from hypothalamic stroke). Hospital acquired
    hypernatremia is iatrogenic and correlates with poor outcomes

- Can also occur from: Na+ overload (salt poisoning, iatrogenic from
    NS infusion, over correction), osmotic diuresis (hyperglycemia,
    SGLT-2 inhibitors, urea, mannitol), diabetes insipidus

Presentation

- Lethargy, irritability, confusion

- Seizures, coma, hemorrhagic stroke, or subarachnoid hemorrhage (from
    the effects of hypertonic serum on cerebral vasculature)

Evaluation

- Step 1: Treat underlying cause (vomiting, hyperglycemia,
    medications)

- Step 2: Determine volume status: If severely hypovolemic, the
    patient will need IV crystalloid to restore volume in addition to
    free water

- Step 3: Estimate and replace free water deficit (FWD):

<!-- -->

- FWD = TBW x \[(serum Na/140) - 1\]

<!-- -->

- Step 4: Account for ongoing insensible losses and electrolyte free
    water clearance

<!-- -->

- Rule of thumb for accounting for electrolyte free water clearance.
    *This is in addition to replacing free water deficit*

    - 0-1 Liter of urine output: Ignore, no need to replace

    - 1-3 Liters of urine output: Replace half of the losses

    - \>3 liters of urine output: Replace all urine losses

<!-- -->

- No evidence that overcorrecting hypernatremia is harmful. In fact,
    there is increased mortality with overly cautious correction or
    under correction

- If able, replace free water enterally. Otherwise, administer D5W
    intravenously

Additional Information

- Pts w/ suspected DI: Consult Nephrology (may require desmopressin or
    may receive desmopressin once stabilized to differentiate between
    central and nephrogenic DI)

- Pts with hypokalemia: giving K decreases total amount of free water
    you are giving the pt

Hyponatremia – Lauren Chan

Background

- Definition:

<!-- -->

- Mild: Na+ 130-134

- Moderate: Na+ 125-129

- Severe: Na+ \<125

<!-- -->

- Hyponatremia occurs when free water reabsorption (i.e. ADH is on) or
    intake exceeds free water excretion

Presentation

- Mild to moderate symptoms: lethargy, N/V, dizziness, confusion,
    fatigue, cramping

- Severe symptoms: obtundation, coma, respiratory arrest, seizure

Evaluation and Management

- Step 1: Serum osm 

<!-- -->

- \>295: Hyper-osmolar, presence of other molecules that contribute to
    serum osmolarity 

    - Glucose, mannitol, iodinated contrast

    - If hyperglycemic, corrected serum Na+ = measured Na+ +
        1.6\*\[(glucose – 100)/100\]  

        - If corrected Na+ is normal, treat hyperglycemia; not a water
            balance problem 

        - If corrected Na+ is low, there is hypotonic hyponatremia +
            coexisting hyperglycemia 

    - Renal failure (urea) and ethanol: Ineffective osmoles that can
        freely diffuse across cells and do NOT lead to hyponatremia

- 275-295: Iso-osmolar 

    - Pseudohyponatremia 2/2 hypertriglyceridemia, paraproteinemia, or
        lipoprotein X: Serum Na not actually low, due to how the lab is
        calculated 

- \<275: Hypo-osmolar à Step 2 

<!-- -->

- Step 2: Urine Osm

<!-- -->

- Surrogate for ADH activity

- Uosm \<100 or Uosm \< Sosm correlates with low ADH

    - Primary polydipsia: Free water intake\>output  

    - Tea and toast: Lack solute to effectively concentrate urine 

    - Beer drinkers’ potomania: Mixture of the two above

- Uosm \>100 or Uosm \> Sosm correlates with high ADH Step 3 

<!-- -->

- Step 3: Urine Na

<!-- -->

- Is ADH on in the setting of decreased effective arterial bloodvolume
    (EABV) or decreased mean arterial pressure (i.e. appropriate ADH)?

- UNa \<20: Low EABV à RAAS upregulation w/ Na avidity-\> appropriate
    ADH release

    - If true volume depletion, then trial 500cc-1L NS bolus and
        monitor serum Na. IVF bolus-\>Increase EABV à ↓ ADH release à ↑
        free water excretion

    - If edematous state (e.g. heart failure or cirrhosis), then
        decongestion with diuretics may improve serum Na

- UNa \>40: Euvolemic with no stimulus for ADH-\> SIADH

    - SIADH from: n/v, malignancy, meds, surgery, pulmonary disease,
        hormones, pain, bladder distension: ↑ ADH out of proportion to
        stimulus  

        - Treat with water restriction. Can add NaCl or urea tabs if
            fluid restriction is severe 

        - Water restriction (L/day) = 600 / uosm (600 mEq Na in
            American diet/day)

        - Salt wasting: diuretics, cerebral salt wasting (aka
            hypovolemic SIADH), SSRIs

        - Other: Hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency 

<!-- -->

- If still stumped, can check a FeNa and measure a serum uric acid

<!-- -->

- FeNa \<0.5 % suggests appropriate ADH activity.

- High uric acid suggests some degree of volume depletion and
    appropriate ADH activity.

Rate of correction

- Acute (\<48 hrs)

<!-- -->

- If symptomatic, give 150 cc bolus 3% NaCl up to two times.

- Monitor Na+ q1-2 hr

- Goal is an initial rapid 4-6 mEq/L correction and then hold

    - May require Hypertonic Saline infusion with DDAVP clamp if at
        risk of over-correcting

<!-- -->

- Chronic (\>48 hrs or unknown, higher risk for osmotic demyelination
    if corrected too quickly):

<!-- -->

- Goal Na+ correction rate 4-6 mEq/L over 24 hrs (Max 8mEq/L)

When to call Nephrology

- If you are worried about rapid over-correction:

<!-- -->

- High risk patients are those with rapidly reversible causes

    - Low solute states (Beer drinker’s potomania, psychogenic
        polydipsia, tea-toast)- as soon as they decrease their excess
        free water intake, they will rapidly clear free water

    - Volume depletion- as volume is replaced and the stimulus for ADH
        release is switched off, then they will rapidly clear the excess
        free water if they have normal underlying kidney function

- High risk for ODS includes: chronic liver disease, Na \<105 meq/dL,
    alcoholism, and malnutrition.

<!-- -->

- Consideration of DDAVP clamp

Hyperkalemia – Mengyao Tang and Amanda Morrison

Background

- Causes:

<!-- -->

- Cellular shifts: Acidemia, Rhabdomyolysis, TLS, beta blockade

- Aldosterone deficient states: T4 RTA, Primary adrenal insufficiency

- Decreased distal tubular delivery: Volume depletion

- Decreased clearance: AKI, CKD, ESRD

- Excessive intake

- Medication-related: ACEi, ARB, MRA, NSAIDs, TMP/SMX, digoxin,
    heparin

<!-- -->

- Pseudo-Hyperkalemia: hemolysis, severe leukocytosis

- Symptoms are rare, but usually manifest as cardiac dysrhythmias

Evaluation

- Confirm hyperkalemia with repeat BMP

- Check EKG for hyperkalemic changes (sensitivity for EKG findings in
    hyper K is poor)

<!-- -->

- K+ 5.5-6.5: peaked T waves, prolonged PR interval

- K+ 6.5-8: prolonged QRS, loss of P wave, ST elevation, ectopic beats

- K+ \>8: sine wave pattern, asystole, PEA, VF

Management

- If EKG changes or signs of instability

<!-- -->

- Calcium gluconate 1g IV (effective within 3-5 min)

    - Stabilizes cardiac membrane for \~60mins

    - SHOULD BE REPEATED HOURLY while hyperkalemic

<!-- -->

- Shift K+ (temporizing measures)

<!-- -->

- D50 w/ regular insulin 10 units (can order using Adult Hyperkalemia
    order set in epic)

    - Use 5 units if there is renal impairment

    - Lasts for 4-6hrs (can be longer in renal impairment)

- Correct acidosis- Consider using isotonic bicarb

- Beta Agonists (e.g. high-dose albuterol nebulizer); lasts 2-4 hrs

    - Note that typical albuterol nebulizer is 2.5mg, need 10-20mg to
        have an effect

<!-- -->

- Increase K+ Excretion

<!-- -->

- Loop diuretic- if the kidneys work, use them

    - If there is AKI or a volume deficit can administer with IVF

- Volume expansion with IVF: Increases distal Na delivery and K
    excretion. NS and LR are likely equally effective.

- GI cation exchangers

    - Kayexalate (Polystyrene sulfonate)- only effective if having
        BMs. 60g PO q2h until bowel movement (If using oral, ensure
        patient is having bowel movements and is not obstructed, could
        cause bowel injury/ necrosis). PO can take up to 6hrs to work.
        Consider per rectal administration for faster action but DO NOT
        GIVE WITH SORBITOL per rectum

    - Lokelma (Sodium-zirconium-cyclosilicate) 10 g PO TID for 48 H.
        Actively exchanges K for other cations within the small bowel
        and works within 2 hours. Remember to stop once the K is normal
        since can cause hypokalemia. Also keep in mind the high Na
        content of Lokelma (400mg/5g dose of lokelma)

        - Needs approval from nephrology

- Hemodialysis: Consult nephrology early if severe hyper K+

Hypokalemia – Peter Thorne and Patrick Steadman

Background

- Potassium (K+) \< 3.5 mEq/L

- 98% of total body K+ is intracellular (majority in muscle cells)

- Goal: prevent life threatening complication (e.g. arrhythmia),
    replace deficit, elucidate cause

- Insulin and catecholamines (Beta adrenoreceptors) are key drivers of
    transcellular shifts

- H+ and K+ will trade places to maintain electroneutrality

Presentation

- Malaise, weakness, myalgias, decreased gastrointestinal motility

- EKG changes:

<!-- -->

- Mild: ST segment depression, decreased T wave amplitude

- Severe: U-waves (most commonly seen in precordial leads V2 and V3)

<!-- -->

- Severe hypokalemia can lead to rhabdomyolysis

Evaluation

- History: decreased K+ intake, increased entry into cells (ex:
    elevated beta-adrenergic activity, hypothermia), GI losses, urinary
    losses (diuretics, hypomagnesemia, RTA, tubular defects,
    hyperaldosteronism)

- If concomitant metabolic alkalosis: Normal/low BP suggests diuretic
    use, vomiting or Gitelman/Bartter syndromes

- Hypertension suggests renovascular disease or primary
    mineralocorticoid excess

- Labs: BMP, CBC, VBG, urine electrolytes, magnesium, POC glucose, CK.
    Possibly aldosterone, renin, cortisol pending clinical context

- Imaging: Renal US, CT AP

Management

- Check Mg+2, replete to 2; Give empirically while waiting for serum
    Mg+2

- K+ preparation (route); replete to 4

- Choice of agent:

<!-- -->

- KCl is used for repletion in the hospital

    - PO tablets for mild asymptomatic hypokalemia

    - IV can be given through peripheral (rate is 10mEq/hr, may have
        burning sensation) or central access

- K+ bicarbonate can be dissolved and put through G tube

    - Useful in pts with hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis

<!-- -->

- Dose:

<!-- -->

- Normal renal function: 10 mEq K+ is expected to raise serum \[K+\]
    by 0.1 mEq/L

- Significant CKD or AKI: at risk of overcorrection

    - Shortcut: multiply the mEq by the Cr = how much K+ expected to
        rise

    - Once K+ higher than 5.5, K+ increases much faster and rules
        above do not apply

Hyperphosphatemia – Peter Thorne and Amanda Morrison

Background

- Phosphate (PO4-3) \>4.5mg/dL

- Etiologies:

<!-- -->

- Cellular shifts: Cellular lysis (TLS, Rhabdomyolysis), Acidemia

- Increased intake/absorption or iatrogenic hyperphosphatemia (Over
    repletion, Vitamin D toxicity, use of Fleet’s enemas, etc.)

- Decreased phosphate clearance (Acute or chronic renal disease,
    hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism)

Presentation

- Symptoms are usually secondary to coexistent hypocalcemia
    (psychosis, seizure, perioral paresthesia’s, muscle weakness)

- Can cause acute phosphate nephropathy with phosphate containing
    laxatives

- Calciphylaxis if concurrent hypercalcemia (high Ca+2 x PO4-3product)

Evaluation

- Labs: BMP (calcium, creatinine), VBG, Vit D, PTH, PTHrP, lactate

Management

- Acute

<!-- -->

- If renal function normal, can often treat with IVF (promote PO4-3
    excretion)

- Consider need for calcium supplementation (see hypocalcemia section)

- If renal function impaired and severe hypocalcemia present =
    consider hemodialysis

<!-- -->

- Chronic

<!-- -->

- Usually secondary to chronic renal failure, goal PO4-3 3.5-5.5 in
    CKD patients

- Renal diet (low PO4-3)

- PO4-3 binders: Ca+2 containing (calcium carbonate and calcium
    acetate) and non Ca+2 containing (sevelamer, lanthanum, and iron
    based such as ferric citrate)

    - Sevelamer is significantly more expensive than calcium
        containing binders

        - Given 3 times daily with meals, started at 800mg (Can be ↑
            to 1,600mg TID)

        - Should not be given if pt is not eating

    - Calcium acetate: started at 1334mg TID with meals

- Limit dose changes to chronic binders upon discharge

- Need to avoid calcium containing binders in patients with
    calciphylaxis

Hypophosphatemia – Peter Thorne

Background

- Required for metabolic pathways (ATP production!)

- Most renal reabsorption occurs in proximal tubule via
    sodium-phosphate cotransporter

- Common causes

<!-- -->

- Internal redistribution, reduced intestinal absorption

- Refeeding syndrome

- Alkalemia

- Phos binders on purpose or inadvertently (calcium, aluminum,
    magnesium antacids)

- Excessive loss (diarrhea, CRRT, increased urinary excretion)

- Proximal tubular dysfunction such as in Fanconi Syndrome

- Hyperparathyroidism causes renal phos wasting

- Post-parathyroidectomy leading to hungry bone syndrome

- Vitamin D deficiency or resistance

Presentation

- Mild Hypophosphatemia (serum \>2.0) rarely symptomatic

- PO4-3\< 2.0: Muscle weakness

- PO4-3\< 1.0: Heart failure, respiratory failure, rhabdomyolysis,
    seizures

- Failure to wean from ventilator

Evaluation

- Urine PO4-3 level if cause not readily apparent

- Calculate Fe PO4-3 (\[U PO4-3 x PCr x 100\]/\[P PO4-3x UCr\])

<!-- -->

- Fe PO4-3 \< 5% = normal renal response to hypophos: redistribution
    or ↓ absorption

- Fe PO4-3 \> 5% = renal phos wasting

Management

- Caution replacing in pts with impaired renal function: start with
    half suggested dose

- If K+ \> 4 and patient requires IV repletion, may need to use sodium
    PO4-3 in place of K+ PO4-3 IV; po preferred unless severe or
    symptomatic, or patient cannot take po

<!-- -->

- K-Phos neutral: oral, each 250mg tablet has 8 mmol of PO4-3 and
    1.1mEq of K+

- K+ PO4-3: IV, each mL has 3mmol PO4-3, 4.4 meq K+

- Na+ PO4-3: IV, each mL has 3mmol PO4-3

<!-- -->

- PO4-3\>1.5: PO: 40 – 80 mmol K+Phos neutral (aim for 1 mmol/kg)
    divided into 3-4 doses/day

- PO4-3 1.25 - 1.5: oral 100 mmol K+ PO4-3neutral in 3-4 divided doses
    if asymptomatic

<!-- -->

- IV: 30 mmol K+ PO4-3over 6 hours (aim for 0.4mmol/kg) if symptomatic

<!-- -->

- PO4-3\<1.25: IV: 80mmol K+Phos over approximately 12 hours (aim for
    0.5mmol/kg)

<!-- -->

- Check serum PO4-3 2-12 hrs after last dose of PO4-3 to determine if
    additional needs

Hypomagnesemia – Mike Tozier

Background

- Definition: Mg2+ \< 1.8 mg/dL, most pts asymptomatic until \<1.2
    mg/dL. Severe \[Mg+2\] \< 1 mg/dL

- Causes:

<!-- -->

- GI losses: Diarrhea, malabsorption, acute pancreatitis, EtOH use,
    TPN, vomiting, NG suction, GI fistulas, anorexia, short gut
    syndrome, small bowel bypass

- Drugs: PPIs, loop diuretics, thiazides, digoxin, amphotericin,
    aminoglycosides, foscarnet, cisplatin, calcineurin inhibitors,
    laxatives, pentamidine

- Kidney losses: post-ATN diuresis, Bartter syndrome and Gitelman
    syndrome

- Cellular shifts: DKA treatment/recovery, refeeding, hungry bone
    syndrome, correction of metabolic acidosis, pancreatitis, EtOH
    withdrawal

- Other: DM, hyper Ca, hyperthyroid, hyperaldosteronism, burns,
    lactation, Vit D deficiency, heat, prolonged exercise, mitral valve
    prolapse, pseudohypomagnesemia 2/2 EDTA tube, lactation

Presentation

- Refractory hypocalcemia or hypokalemia, arrhythmias, muscle weakness

- Severe symptoms: seizures, drowsiness, confusion, coma, arrhythmias

- Vertical nystagmus, tetany (Chvostek sign, Trousseau), tremors,
    fasciculations

Evaluation

- EKG: Initially wide QRS, peaked Ts. Progresses to wide PR,
    diminished T, arrhythmias

- Labs: Ca+2, K+, can use FEMg (order urine Mg+2 and Cr, serum Cr and
    Mg) or 24-hour urine for Mg to distinguish renal vs GI etiology
    (FEMg\>2% renal, \<2% GI)

Management

- Correct underlying cause, replete based on severity (Dosing below
    for normal GFR)

- Oral: asymptomatic pts, can cause GI symptoms, not well absorbed

<!-- -->

- Sustained release (Mg Chloride or Mg L-lactate) better tolerated and
    absorbed, though standard preparations (Mg oxide) are faster acting

- Mg chloride: 3-4 tabs BID (total 30 to 56 meq \[15 to 28 mmol\]) for
    severe hypo Mg

- 2-4 tabs daily (total 10 to 28 meq \[5 to 14 mmol\]) for mild hypo
    Mg

- Mg oxide: 400-800 mg BID (20 to 40 mmol \[40 to 80 meq\]) for
    mod-severe hypo Mg

<!-- -->

- Intravenous: for symptomatic patients or if GI intolerance to oral

<!-- -->

- Mg \<1 mg/dL: 4 to 8g of MgSO4 (32 to 64 meq \[16 to 32 mmol\]) over
    12 to 24 hrs

- Mg 1 to 1.5 mg/dL: 4 g MgSO4 (16 to 32 meq \[8 to 16 mmol\]) over 4
    to 12 hrs

- Mg 1.6 to 1.9 give 1 to 2 grams MgSO4 (8 to 16 meq \[4 to 8 mmol\])
    1-2 hrs

    - VUMC only has 4g bags of IV mag so would need to ask nurses to
        only infuse 1/2 bag

- Infusion rate should not exceed 2 g/hr to minimize urinary excretion

Additional Information

- Renal impairment: replete with caution, reduce dose by 50-75% and
    monitor closely

- If persistent hypo Mg in pts requiring diuresis, try K-sparing
    diuretic (e.g. Amiloride)

- Treat concomitant hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or hypophosphatemia

- In pts with concomitant hypophos and hypocalcemia, IV Mg alone -\>
    worse hypophos

Approach to Urinalysis – Laura Binari, Patrick Steadman

Background

- 3 components: Gross Evaluation, Dipstick Analysis, Microscopic Exam

- Indications: dysuria, gross hematuria, fever + GU symptoms, AKI,
    volume overload

- If Foley, obtain sample from catheter, not the urine bag

- Spinning Urine

<!-- -->

- At VUMC, take sample to lab on 4th floor to centrifuge the sample at
    1500 rpm for 5 minutes, remove supernatant and then resuspend
    sediment, place drops of urine on the slide, examine with microscope

- At the VA, there is a microscopy room where you can spin urine as
    well

- Ideally, the specimen should be a fresh catch (\<2-4 hours old);
    Beware: casts like to migrate to the edges of the coverslip!

Gross Evaluation

- Turbid: Infection, precipitated crystals, or chyluria

- Color: Red Urine (broad DDx, see Hematuria section, includes certain
    meds such as rifampin/phenytoin), White (polyuria, phosphate
    crystals), Green (methylene blue), Pink (uric acid crystals,
    post-propofol infusion), Black (hemoglobinuria/myoglobinuria)

Dipstick Analysis

- Quality of sample: should have zero squamous epithelial cells

<!-- -->

- Specific gravity: normal = 1.010

- Surrogate for urine osmolality & hydration: can have falsely high
    specific gravity if large particles (contrast, glucose) present

- Trick: Last 2 digits of S.G. x 30 = Uosm. For example: S.G. is
    1.013; 13 x 30 = 390 mOsm/L

<!-- -->

- Urinary pH: normal pH is 5.5-6.5

<!-- -->

- Alkaline pH: bicarb suppl, vegan diet, urease producing organisms
    (staghorn calculi)

- Acidic pH: uric acid stones, appropriate response to acidemia

<!-- -->

- Proteinuria: dipstick detects albumin ONLY (not paraproteins)

<!-- -->

- Mild albuminuria (30-300 mg/day) not detected by standard dipsticks

- F/u with spot protein to Cr ratio or 24 hr urine collection
    (nephrotic range \>3.5 g/day)

- Transient: due to volume depletion, CHF, fever, postural,
    exercise-induced

- Ddx: primary glomerular dx, secondary glomerular dx (DM, amyloid,
    infxn, sickle cell, etc.) vs tubular vs overflow (multiple myeloma)

<!-- -->

- Heme (see hematuria section): False(+) if semen, false(-) w/
    ascorbic acid

- WBC:

<!-- -->

- False(+) 2/2 contamination with squamous cells. If bacteria -\>
    consider UTI/pyelo w/hematuria -\> inflammation; May have sterile
    pyuria

- Ddx includes chlamydia, ureaplasma, TB, malignancy, viral infxn,
    kidney stones, GN, urethritis, steroid, cyclophosphamide use

<!-- -->

- Ketones:

<!-- -->

- Never normal in urine; only detects acetic acid

- Ddx: DKA, starvation ketoacidosis, pregnancy, keto diet

<!-- -->

- Glucose: max threshold at proximal tubule exceeded (\~serum glucose
    180 mg/dL)

<!-- -->

- DM, Cushing’s, liver/pancreatic dx, SGLT2i use; or a primary defect
    of proximal reabsorption (w/phosphaturia, uricosuria, amino aciduria
    think Fanconi syndrome)

<!-- -->

- Leukocyte esterase: enzyme released by lysed neutrophils,
    macrophages

<!-- -->

- Associated with pyuria and infections; false(-) from hematuria or
    glucosuria

<!-- -->

- Nitrites: reduction of urinary nitrates by nitrate reductase

<!-- -->

- Certain bacteria (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae) express, others (e.g.
    Enterococci) do not

<!-- -->

- Bilirubin: conjugated = water soluble (passes through glomerulus),
    unlike unconjugated

<!-- -->

- Liver dysfunction and biliary obstruction

<!-- -->

- Urobilinogen: end product of conjugated bilirubin, normally
    \~1.0mg/dL is normal

<!-- -->

- Can be elevated due to hepatocellular dx or hemolysis

Microscopic Examination of the Urine Sediment

- Cells:

<!-- -->

- Dysmorphic RBCs (sign of GN), squamous epithelial cells
    (contamination), tubular cells (abnormal, indicates renal dx),
    neutrophils (UTI, AIN, TB, sterile pyuria), eosinophils (think AIN,
    not sensitive thus cannot exclude diagnosis)

<!-- -->

- Casts:

<!-- -->

- Hyaline (pyelo; CKD, normal subjects), RBC (GN), WBC (GN, pyelo,
    interstitial dx, inflammation), epithelial - renal tubular cells
    (ATN, interstitial nephritis, nephritic sx, heavy metal ingestion),
    granular or waxy (presence of kidney disease, but nonspecific),
    muddy brown casts (ATN); fatty (nephrotic syndrome)

<!-- -->

- Crystals:

<!-- -->

- Ca++ oxalate (envelope/dumbbell shape), uric acid (rhombic/rosette
    shaped, classically formed in acidic urine), cystine (hexagonal,
    found in cystinuria), Mg ++ ammonium phosphate (aka struvite stones,
    from increased ammonia production, in setting of urease producing
    bacteria such as Proteus or Klebsiella UTIs)

- Calcium oxalate crystals + AKI, consider ethylene glycol
    intoxication

- Uric Acid crystals + AKI, consider tumor lysis syndrome

Hematuria – Laura Binari/Patrick Steadman

Background

- Definition: 3 urinalyses with three or more RBC/hpf; 1 urinalysis
    with 100 RBC/hpf or gross hematuria (1 cc blood/L urine can induce
    color change)

- Causes:

<!-- -->

- Can be transient (exercise-induced, menses, trauma)

- Concurrent pyuria/dysuria: consider urinary tract infection or
    bladder malignancy

    - Malignancy risk factors: male sex, age \> 50, smoking Hx,
        exposures to benzene/aromatic amine, cyclophosphamide,
        indwelling foreign body, pelvis irradiation, chronic UTIs, heavy
        NSAID use, urologic disorders (nephrolithiasis, BPH)

- Recent URI: think infection related glomerulonephritis, IgA,
    vasculitis, anti-GBM

- Positive Family Hx of Hematuria: consider PKD, Sickle Cell Disease

- Bleeding from other sites: think inherited/acquired bleeding
    disorder, anticoagulation

- Unilateral Flank Pain: Ureteral calculus, renal malignancy, IgA
    Nephropathy

Evaluation

- Step 1: Confirm the presence of hematuria

<!-- -->

- Dipstick positive heme: urinary RBCs (hematuria), free myoglobin or
    free hemoglobin

- Centrifuge the urine

    - Red sediment -\> true hematuria (urinary RBCs)

    - Red supernatant +

        - Positive dipstick: myoglobulin or hemoglobin

        - Negative dipstick porphyria, Pyridium, beets, rhubarb, or
            ingestion of food dyes

|                            | Glomerular              | Extraglomerular     |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Color (if gross hematuria) | Red, Cola, Smoky        | Red/Pink            |
| Clots                      | Absent                  | Present/Absent      |
| Proteinuria                | May be \>500 mg/day     | \<500 mg/day        |
| RBC morphology             | Dysmorphic RBCs present | Normal (isomorphic) |
| RBC casts                  | May be present          | Absent              |

- Step 2: Determine if there is a GLOMERULAR or NON-GLOMERULAR source
    of bleeding

<!-- -->

- Glomerular Bleeding:

    - Isolated Hematuria: Differential includes IgA Nephropathy, thin
        BM dx, Alport’s

    - Nephritic syndrome (new proteinuria, pyuria, HTN, edema, rise in
        Cr): post-infectious GN, MPGN, ANCA vasculitis, Goodpasture’s,
        lupus nephritis

    - Workup: anti-GMB, anti-DNase/ASO, ANA, ANCA, C3, C4, cryo, Hep B
        & C, HIV

    - Indications for Renal Biopsy: glomerular bleeding + risk factors
        for progressive disease, including albuminuria \> 30 mg/day, new
        hypertension \> 140/90 or significant elevation over baseline
        BP, rise in serum creatinine

- Extraglomerular Bleeding (Imaging Section)

    - If historical clues suggest nephrolithiasis, start with non-con
        CT A/P

    - Gross Hematuria otherwise should be evaluated with CT A/P w/ and
        w/o contrast (CT urography); consult urology for cystoscopy
        (often done as outpatient referral)

    - If clots are passed, more likely to be secondary to lower
        urinary source, and if a high burden of clots poses a risk of
        obstruction (urologic emergency)

    - If extraglomerular bleeding with clots: hematuria catheter needs
        to be placed ASAP (2 valve catheter, 20-24 Fr (!); page urology
        if nursing unable to obtain)

- CT Urography is more sensitive than IV pyelogram for renal masses
    and stones.

- Prefer Renal and Bladder Ultrasound in pregnant patients

- All pts w/gross hematuria that is non-glomerular in source, in whom
    infection has been ruled out, warrant cystoscopy. Additionally, all
    patients with clots need cystoscopy

Kidney Transplant Medicine – Trey Richardson

Introduction

- The goal of this section is to serve as a guide for tackling the
    most common transplant complications as well as offer a few tips for
    managing immunosuppression while kidney transplant patients are
    admitted to the hospital

Alphabet soup

- PRA: panel reactive antibodies

- DSA: donor specific antibodies

- CMV (-/+): indicates the CMV status of both the recipient and the
    donor

- FK506 or FK: another name for tacrolimus

- KDPI: Kidney donor profile index used to “grade” the quality of the
    donated organ

- X/6 MM: indicates the number of HLA subtypes that are mismatched
    between donor and recipient

Infections in Kidney Transplant Recipients

Background

- Infections in a kidney transplant recipient can be divided into 3
    phases:

<!-- -->

- \<1-month post-transplant

    - Surgical site infections, nosocomial infections (e.g. C. Diff,
        CAUTIs, and CLABSIs), and donor-derived infections/reactivation
        of latent recipient infections predominate

- 1-6 months post-transplant

    - Depleted immune-system regenerates increased risk for
        disseminated fungal (e.g. PJP, histo/blasto) and viral
        infections (HSV, adenovirus)

- \>6 months post-transplant

    - Risk for atypical infections persists, but common community
        acquired syndromes should still be on the differential

<!-- -->

- This section will focus on the most common infection in kidney
    transplant recipients- infections of the urinary tract

Evaluation

- UA with culture 

- Examine the native kidneys (CVA tenderness) AND the allograft
    (almost always in RLQ, denervated so the graft itself will not be
    tender, but the surrounding soft-tissue may)

- Renal U/S (of both allograft and native kidneys) or CT AP if:

<!-- -->

- Early post-op (1 month)

- Recurrent (2+ episodes in year)

- History of nephrolithiasis or if sepsis/bacteremia

<!-- -->

- Blood cultures if systemic signs/symptoms

- Consider testing for C. urealyticum, and sending fungal and AFB
    urine cultures if UA is recurrently positive but culture negative

Management

- Remove or replace indwelling catheters

- Review prior culture susceptibilities (if available)

- Empiric antibiotic regimens:

<!-- -->

- Asymptomatic bacteriuria: treat with FQ or beta lactam for 5-7 days
    if \<3 mos post-transplant

- Simple cystitis: Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin 250 BID or Levaquin
    500 mg daily), Augmentin (500 mg BID), 3rd gen cephalosporin
    (cefpodoxime 100 mg BID or cefixime 400 mg daily) or nitrofurantoin
    100 mg BID (if GFR\>30, only treats cystitis since drug only
    concentrates in the urine)

    - \< 6 mos post-transplant: treat for 10-14 days

    - \>6 mos post-transplant: treat for 5-7 days

- Complicated UTI/Pyelonephritis (cover Pseudomonas, gram negatives
    and Enterococcus): Ceftriaxone 2g daily (preferred), Cefepime 2g
    q8hrs (add Vancomycin when using cephalosporin if suspicious for
    enterococcus) or Pip-tazo 3.75g q6hrs, can also use meropenem 1g q8h
    (need ID approval)

    - Treat for 14-21 days

    - For stable pts with mild complicated UTI, can consider giving
        more narrow empiric antibiotics: Augmentin 875 mg BID or
        ciprofloxacin 500 mg q12h

- MDR UTI: Consult transplant ID

    - Options: meropenem-vaborbactam, ceftolozone-tazobactam,
        ceftazidime-avibactam

- In pts w/PCKD, include lipophilic antibiotic (such as ciprofloxacin)
    to penetrate cysts

Prevention

- Bactrim used for PJP prophylaxis during first 6 mos post-transplant
    also prevents UTIs

- Basic infection prevention measures for all comers (e.g. hydration,
    frequent voiding, wiping front to back, voiding after sexual
    intercourse)

Acute Kidney Injury of Kidney Transplant

Background

- Most patients admitted to medicine services with kidney transplants
    are \>3 months post-op. Therefore, we are typically not managing
    perioperative complications such as delayed graft function, or
    hyper-acute rejection. Below are the most common causes of acute
    kidney injury in kidney transplant recipients.

Evaluation

- Signs and symptoms of UTI?

- Assess volume status

- Review meds for recent medication changes

<!-- -->

- Common offenders: NSAIDs, ACE, diuretics, azole antifungals

- Medication non-adherence

<!-- -->

- Tacrolimus (FK) or cyclosporine (CsA) level

<!-- -->

- FK levels increase with n/v, diarrhea due to alterations in
    p-glycoprotein expression within inflamed GI tract

- FK toxicity also causes diarrhea and volume depletion

<!-- -->

- Proteinuria:

<!-- -->

- Transplant patients with 1 g/day proteinuria usually get biopsies

<!-- -->

- Review donor characteristics (CMV status, PRA, % HLA antibodies
    present, DSAs)

- BK PCR: consider only if unclear source of AKI and no recent titers

<!-- -->

- Serum PCR is test of choice

<!-- -->

- Renal transplant U/S (costly and not always warranted)

<!-- -->

- \< 1 week post-transplant: If acute graft dysfunction, look for
    thrombosis, urine/ureter leak

- \> 1 week post-transplant:

    - Cr does not respond to 48 hours of current management

    - Lack of clear, reversible causes

    - Hydronephrosis (can occur after stent removal 4-6 wks after
        transplant or due to perinephric fluid collection)

    - Arterial stenosis (↑ velocities in renal artery -- very
        concerning when velocity \>300), tardus parvus waveforms)

    - Perinephric abscess with recurrent UTI/pyelonephritis

    - Urinoma (usually first 2-3 weeks), hematoma (after a biopsy)

- Unique findings:

    - Resistive indices: reflect central renal vascular compliance.
        High indices in transplant patients signify parenchymal problem
        (rejection, infection, ATN)

<!-- -->

- Biopsy

<!-- -->

- To differentiate ATN vs rejection vs BK nephropathy vs recurrent
    disease (FSGS, lupus, etc.)

- Post Biopsy Care:

    - Watch for bleeding and HTN

    - Blood can get into collecting system, then the capsule, and into
        the perinephric space causing Page Kidney (aka Pressure
        Tamponade)

        - Compressed renal vessels-\> RAAS surge --\> rapid, severe
            HTN (STAT page the renal fellow)

Kidney Transplant Rejection

Background

- Rejection is divided into acute vs chronic and T-cell mediated or
    antibody mediated

<!-- -->

- Pathologists can determine the type of rejection and the chronicity
    by observing the structures that are acutely involved (e.g.
    tubulitis, glomerulitis, arteritis, and capillaritis) as well as the
    time course of involvement (e.g. presence of fibrosis)

- Structures exhibiting fibrosis represent chronic rejection that is
    unlikely to respond to treatment, whereas acute inflammation may be
    amenable to acute therapies

- This section will focus on acute rejection since this is the
    clinical entity we will most likely manage while on the wards

Acute Rejection

- Acute T cell mediated rejection

<!-- -->

- Infiltration of the graft by lymphocytes and inflammatory cells
    characterized by tubulitis, interstitial inflammation, and arteritis
    (on occasion)

- Treatment:

    - High dose glucocorticoids (methyl prednisolone) is first line
        (\~ 5 days)

    - Thymoglobulin (polyclonal Ig anti-T cell)

        - Use depends on severity of rejection

        - Indicated if Cr fails to improve after steroids

        - T cell subsets are measured during treatment until depleted

    - Tacro target levels are reset to \~8-10 if treated for acute T
        cell mediated rejection

<!-- -->

- Acute antibody mediated rejection (ABMR)

<!-- -->

- Donor specific antibody mediated rejection characterized by
    glomerulitis, peri-tubular capillaritis (microcirculation
    inflammation), complement deposition (C4d staining), and presence of
    DSA

- Treatment = B-cell depletion therapy

    - IV methyl prednisone 500 mg IV x 3-5 days

    - Plasmapheresis (If with high titers of DSA)

    - IVIG 2 g/kg (max 140 g)

    - Rituximab 375 mg/m2

Kidney Transplant Immunosuppression

Background

- Most patients with kidney transplants are on triple therapy with an
    anti-metabolite (azathioprine or mycophenolate compound) or mTOR
    inhibitor + calcineurin inhibitor + prednisone

- You may also come across patients who are on monthly infusions with
    belatacept, a selective T-cell co-stimulation blocker

Calcineurin inhibitors

- Tacrolimus (FK), cyclosporine (CsA)

<!-- -->

- Envarsus XR is a once a day long acting formulation of tacrolimus

- Common side-effects

    - Worsening kidney function: mediated by vasoconstriction to the
        afferent arterioles

    - Hypertension- treat with CCBs

    - Diabetes

    - Hand tremors, headache, nausea

    - Thrombotic microangiopathy

    - T4 RTA- hyperkalemia

    - Gingival hyperplasia

mTOR Inhibitors

- Sirolimus, everolimus

<!-- -->

- Major side effects: Poor wound healing, rarely pneumonitis

Anti-metabolites

- Azathioprine

- Mycophenolate preparations: Mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept, MMF),
    Mycophenolic acid (Myfortic)

- Side effects: Bone marrow suppression- hold for lymphopenia; GI
    upset- hold for diarrhea

Additional Information for Overnight Admits:

- Do not change immunosuppression

<!-- -->

- Exception: If pt has severe diarrhea, can hold night tacro dose and
    inform the day team

<!-- -->

- Daily tacrolimus or cyclosporine level (order qam at 5:00). Always
    order tacrolimus or cyclosporine dose at 6:00 am and 6:00 pm
    (regardless of what time patient takes at home, lab can only run am
    tacro levels at a certain time in batches)

<!-- -->

- EXCEPTION: If late afternoon admission, consider paging the fellow
    (since its early) and ask if they want the evening dose held until
    the am level comes back

<!-- -->

- Transplant patients with normal kidney function can have regular
    diet

Neurologic Emergencies

Stroke

Background

- Preferred term: Stroke (CVA is like saying heart attack instead of
    STEMI)

- Sudden onset, focal (usually one-sided) neurologic deficits:
    weakness, sensory loss, vision loss, ataxia/unsteadiness, vertigo,
    double vision, facial droop, dysarthria, aphasia

- Differential:

<!-- -->

- stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)

- seizure or post-ictal paralysis

- headache phenomena (complex migraine)

- cervical spinal cord lesions, though these more commonly cause
    bilateral symptoms

<!-- -->

- Stroke-like symptoms can also develop as recrudescence – previous
    stroke or brain lesion symptoms worsening with systemic
    toxic/metabolic/infectious processes or hypotension

Evaluation

- Critical decision-making information: last known normal (LKN), time
    symptoms first observed, anticoagulation status, recent surgeries,
    history of bleeding (severe GIB or ICH), recent medications,
    platelet count, and baseline neuro exam

- If symptoms developed with LKN within 24 hours -\> stroke alert!

- **If \> 24 hours, can request Neuroalert Instead**

<!-- -->

- VUMC: call 11111 and tell the operator stroke alert and current
    patient location

- NAVA: call an RRT and stat page 835-5137, include in the page 911 at
    the end of the call back number to signal it is a stroke alert

<!-- -->

- Stat head CTP (order CTH/CTA) for consideration of tPA or
    endovascular therapy

<!-- -->

- If renal function is abnormal, discuss with neurology

- Generally, go for CTA if the patient is a thrombectomy candidate
    **(within 24 hrs of onset)**

- MRI/MRA is an option but takes longer (MRAs are also better with
    Gadolinium)

- Neurology service should be leading this portion

Management

- Blood pressure goals

<!-- -->

- Ischemic stroke:

    - In general aim for SBP \<220

    - Patients with intracranial atherosclerosis may require higher BP
        to maintain perfusion

- Hemorrhagic stroke:

    - SBP \< 140 (BP management is key)

    - These pts are managed in Neuro ICU

    - Reverse coagulopathies and keep platelets \>100,000

Status Epilepticus

Background

- Either a single seizure \>5 minutes or ≥2 seizures occurring without
    a return to baseline in between

- Differentiating convulsive seizures from non-epileptic events
    (“pseudoseizure”):

<!-- -->

- Features that suggest non-epileptic/psychogenic event include
    moaning or talking throughout the event, “no-no” head shake,
    repetitive movements of opposing muscle groups, very arrhythmic or
    purposeful-looking movements, or seizures that have been ongoing for
    “hours”

Evaluation

- Fingerstick glucose, BMP/CBC, and UDS

- Consult Neurology

- EEG (start with 2hr) to determine if it is seizure or not and for
    titration of medications

- Consider a non-contrasted head CT; MRI cannot be obtained while EEG
    is attached

- Up to half of pts presenting in status epilepticus have no history
    of seizure, so they need urgent head imaging, consideration for
    lumbar puncture, infectious and toxic workup, tox screen, and
    sometimes rheumatologic or paraneoplastic workup

- If Hx of seizure or on Antiseizure meds (ASMs) please order trough
    levels

Management

- ABCs! Start with benzos:

<!-- -->

- 2 mg lorazepam IV then repeat q1-3 minutes up to 0.1 mg/kg OR

- 5 mg of diazepam IV every minute (takes longer to give diazepam so
    would give concurrent ASM)

- 10 mg IM midazolam if no IV access

<!-- -->

- After 2 rounds of benzos, would shift to antiepileptics if still in
    status (neurology should be contacted here if not already):

<!-- -->

- IV fosphenytoin 20 mg/kg

- IV levetiracetam 30-60 mg/kg **(generally 3g, up to 4.5g max)**

- IV valproic acid 30 mg/kg

<!-- -->

- If still seizing at this point, the patient will likely need
    intubation

- These pts MUST be placed on EEG if they get paralyzed or sedated
    because convulsive status often continues as nonconvulsive status,
    which still damages the brain!

<!-- -->

- If still seizing, patients should be on midazolam, propofol or
    barbiturate infusions

- Focal seizures, such as arm or face twitching with retained
    awareness do not always need to be treated to the point of
    initiating coma

Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS)

Background

- Disorders of the neuromuscular junction

- MG affects the post-synaptic cleft at the acetylcholine receptor

- LEMS affects the pre-synaptic cleft at the calcium channels

<!-- -->

- Many cases are paraneoplastic (classically small cell lung
    carcinoma)

Presentation

- Double vision, ptosis, dysarthria, dysphagia

- Dyspnea looks different than in other conditions: air hunger,
    usually also with dysphagia

- Initially, the patient may not look sick or distressed, but may have
    a short inspiratory time or difficulty speaking in complete
    sentences due to shallow breathing

- Most pts have a known history of myasthenia, but up to 20% present
    initially with crisis

Evaluation

- Exam

<!-- -->

- Look closely for ptosis, nasal speech, weak neck flexion/extension
    (same nerve roots as diaphragm), interrupted speech to take extra
    breaths

- These patients do not exhibit “huffing and puffing” like in
    COPD/asthma exacerbations

    - Patients with NMJ disease can go from talking to intubated
        within several hours!

- LEMS: less ocular weakness, but do have extremity weakness and
    absent reflexes.

- Pulmonary compromise is very rare in LEMS

<!-- -->

- EMG/NCS

<!-- -->

- MG: decremental response to repetitive stimulation

- LEMS: increased amplitude in response to repetitive stimulation

<!-- -->

- Labs

<!-- -->

- Myasthenia antibody panels (send prior to IVIG/PLEX being given)

<!-- -->

- Imaging

<!-- -->

- Consider chest CT to look for thymic hyperplasia

Management

- Monitor NIF (negative inspiratory force) at baseline and q4h

<!-- -->

- Measure of diaphragmatic strength

- Normal is \<-60

- If below -30, consider elective intubation

- Note that patient effort will affect NIF values

<!-- -->

- IVIG or PLEX

<!-- -->

- Both have similar supportive evidence; IVIG is usually easier to do

- PLEX has the risks you would expect with dialysis (e.g. fluid
    shifts) and coagulopathy

- IVIG -\> check IgA levels. Can increase risk of DVT, has risk of
    aseptic meningitis and provides significant fluid load so not ideal
    for pts with CHF

<!-- -->

- Steroids

<!-- -->

- Usually up-titrated SLOWLY (by 10-20 mg prednisone daily)

- Rapid increases in steroids can worsen patients with MG**, so talk
    to neuro before adjusting**

<!-- -->

- Pyridostigmine

<!-- -->

- Typically continue at their home dose

- Too much pyridostigmine can make patients worse (more secretions),
    so for those doing poorly on \>90 mg per dose, consider lowering the
    dose

<!-- -->

- Treat underlying causes of exacerbations: usually infections or
    other toxic/metabolic insults

- Remove/avoid exacerbating medications: fluoroquinolones,
    aminoglycosides, beta blockers, and magnesium

- LEMS specific management:

<!-- -->

- 3,4-diaminopyridine

- Can respond to IVIG or pyridostigmine

- **Workup for underlying neoplasm**

Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (AIDP)

Background

- Rapid onset polyneuropathy that manifests most often with ascending
    weakness and numbness that can involve the respiratory and facial
    musculature

- Usually preceded by infectious illness a few weeks prior

- **Patients are much more likely to get AIDP from an infection than
    any vaccine, weak vaccine links to AIDP are an addition 1-2 cases
    per million flu vaccines.**

Presentation

- Acute, progressive extremity weakness, weak or absent reflexes, and
    potentially subjective sensatory changes, especially back pain

<!-- -->

- There are a TON of variants of AIDP, with some having cranial nerve
    weakness early, proximal weakness, sensory ataxia, primarily sensory
    loss, or rapid muscle weakness; do not use lack of classic ascending
    weakness to dismiss the idea of AIDP

- Sensory loss is common in an ascending pattern too

Evaluation

- LP – albuminocytologic dissociation = high protein with normal cell
    count

<!-- -->

- One exception is HIV, which can cause AIDP but also have a high cell
    count and high protein count

<!-- -->

- EMG/NCS

<!-- -->

- Demyelinating pattern (temporal dispersion and decreased conduction
    velocities).

- **This can be normal in the first few days, and is most useful 2+
    weeks out if the diagnosis is still unclear**

<!-- -->

- Differential diagnosis: spinal cord lesions, LEMS, MG, acute HIV or
    HCV, viral myelitis (entero/West Nile)

Management

- ABCs! NIF at baseline then Q4-6 hours

<!-- -->

- NIF \< -30 with good effort generally warrants ICU monitoring

<!-- -->

- IVIG or PLEX

- Can get worse with steroids

Elevated Intracranial Pressure (ICP) and Hydrocephalus

Background

- Communicating hydrocephalus (i.e. non-obstructive)

<!-- -->

- Causes: subarachnoid granule scarring after subarachnoid hemorrhage
    or meningitis, ependymoma producing excess CSF, venous sinus
    thrombosis

<!-- -->

- Non-communicating hydrocephalus (i.e. obstructive)

<!-- -->

- Causes: tumor, abscess, or hematoma in the midline ventricular
    structures

<!-- -->

- Eventually, elevated ICP will cause brain herniation

Presentation

- Headache, blurred vision, visual field reduction, enlarged blind
    spot, nausea, vomiting, syncope, coma

- Sixth nerve palsies are common

- Third nerve palsies **(blown pupil)** are classically associated
    with uncal herniation

Evaluation

- Good visual exam: visual fields, enlarged blind spot, papilledema
    (may not be present if very rapid ICP increase, even with vision
    loss), and 6th nerve palsies

- Stat head CT to look for obstructions, mass lesions

<!-- -->

- NSGY evaluation if obstructive lesion (removal vs ventricular drain)

<!-- -->

- CTV or MRV to look for venous sinus thrombosis

<!-- -->

- Venous sinus thrombosis needs AC, even if there is some degree of
    hemorrhagic infarction

<!-- -->

- If no obstructive lesion LP with opening pressure

<!-- -->

- If workup is otherwise normal, except for elevated opening pressure
    diagnosis = IIH

Management

- Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)

<!-- -->

- Diamox and/or topiramate

- Ophthalmology evaluation emergently for consideration of nerve
    sheath fenestrations or urgent VPS placement if severe disc edema

- If there is clinical concern for herniation:

    - Mannitol: 50g IV, can be given peripherally. Has risks of renal
        injury

    - Hypertonic saline: 3%, 7% or 23% saline can be given, needs
        central access

    - Maintain head of bed at least 30° and loosen neck obstructions
        (c-collars) as able

    - NSGY consult for shunt consideration

- Hyperventilation can be done with goal PaCO2 30-34 mm Hg or ETCO2
    20-30 mmHg but is only a temporizing measure **and risks rebound
    edema**

    - After 4-6 hrs, compensatory pH changes in the blood prevent
        vasoconstrictive affects

Common Neurologic Problems

Altered Mental Status (AMS)

Background

- Definition: Change in a patient’s baseline cognition

<!-- -->

- Can be hypoactive (lethargic) or hyperactive (agitated)

<!-- -->

- Risk factors: Functional impairment, age \> 75, dementia,
    depression, ETOH/substance use disorder, sensory impairment, recent
    surgery

Etiologies: Consider MOVE STUPID mnemonic

- Metabolic (Hypo/hypernatremia, Hypercalcemia)

- Oxygen (Hypoxia)

- Vascular (CVA, Bleed, MI, CHF)

- Endocrine (Hypoglycemia, Thyroid, Adrenal)

- Seizure (postictal state)

- Trauma

- Uremia

- Psychiatric

- Infection

- Drugs – intoxication, withdrawal, or medications

- Delirium – see “Delirium” section in psychiatry

Evaluation

- Consider broad toxic, metabolic, and infectious workup as
    appropriate

<!-- -->

- TSH, Vitamin B12, CBC, CMP, UA, CXR, VBG, blood Cx, glucose, UDS

<!-- -->

- Review of medications

<!-- -->

- Sedatives, anticholinergics, benzos/EtOH toxicity or withdrawal

<!-- -->

- Head imaging in the setting of focal neurologic findings

<!-- -->

- Start with head CT – note strokes take up to 24 hours to show up on
    CT

- Consider MRI if high concern for stroke, inflammatory changes or
    infection

<!-- -->

- LP should be performed if there is any concern for meningitis

- EEG is reasonable with fluctuating mental status or seizure-like
    activity

Management

- First line: nonpharmacologic interventions: HOMMEEESS

<!-- -->

- Hydration/nutrition: ensure patient fed, rule out constipation and
    urinary retention

- Orientation

- Mobilize out of bed 3x/daily as able

- Manage pain

- Eliminate unnecessary devices (restraints, catheters, tele, lines)
    and meds

- Environmental modification: minimize devices, lights on/windows open
    during day

- Engage family

- Sensory restoration: use eyeglasses and hearing aids and reorient

- Sleep protocol: minimize nighttime vitals, earplugs, sleep mask and
    no TV at night

<!-- -->

- Second line: Pharmacologic approaches, see "Delirium" in section in
    psychiatry

Seizure without Status Epilepticus

Background

- Risk factors: birth trauma, prematurity, TBI with loss of awareness
    \> 1 hours or penetrating wound, strokes/tumors/abscesses, history
    of meningitis/encephalitis

- Key for seizures: stereotyped event with sudden onset/offset

<!-- -->

- Generally, if full body systems are involved (e.g., jerking or tonic
    activity), then there will also be loss of awareness

Evaluation

- A clear description or recording of seizure semiology is helpful

- Provoked seizures can develop with medications, hypo/hyperglycemia,
    significant electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hyponatremia), and CNS
    infections

- EEG is necessary for spell capture

- MRI brain with and without contrast once stable

Non-Epileptic Spells (aka PNES, psychogenic non-epileptic spells)

- Can be very difficult to distinguish from epileptic seizures

- Features more common in PNES

<!-- -->

- Retained awareness with bilateral extremity “seizing”

- Opisthotonus (arching the back)

- Talking during a spell

- Excessively long spells (e.g. lasts hour or days)

- Forced eye closure

- Coachability during a spell or reacting to external stimuli

- Heavy breathing during a spell with lots of rigorous movement

- Immediately returning to normal after a spell

<!-- -->

- Features more common in epileptic seizures:

<!-- -->

- Seizures arising out of sleep

- Highly stereotyped

- Incontinence

- Severe injuries (e.g. burns)

<!-- -->

- Management

<!-- -->

- Try to avoid excessive BZD use

- This requires good clinical judgement as you wouldn't want to
    withhold Ativan and discover that the pt was having true atypical
    seizures. The compromise would be: do not repeatedly administer BZDs
    when there is suspicion for PNES as well as no evidence of response
    to prior BZD administration.

Syncopal Convulsions

- Very common, can present with posturing and tonic-clonic movements
    happening for a few moments after syncope

<!-- -->

- Should not last for more than 30 seconds

- These are just related to syncope and do not typically require
    seizure medications

- Workup:

    - Two-hour EEG and MRI (with and without contrast)

    - Infectious workup, BMP, CBC, blood glucose, toxicology/drug
        screen

    - If there is concern for convulsive syncope, (carefully) check
        orthostatic vitals

Inpatient Headache (HA)

Background

- Important to distinguish primary and secondary headache

- Red flags for secondary headaches (SNOOPP): Systemic symptoms,
    Neurologic symptoms, Onset that is sudden (thunderclap), Older age
    (new headache \>40), Progression or evolution in previous headaches,
    Postural component

- Other red flags: preceding trauma, headache awakening patient from
    sleep, no headache-free intervals, thunderclap headache (maximal
    intensity develops within 11 minutes or less)

Evaluation

- Get a good description of where the pain is, when, associated
    symptoms, and assess for “red flag” features listed above

- If there are any red flag features imaging and workup are necessary

- Imaging depends on highest suspicions, but CTA head/neck is
    appropriate to evaluate for aneurysm (including neck to consider
    dissection). If any focal signs, MRI is generally preferred; venous
    imaging can be beneficial in headaches with features of elevated ICP

- If no red flag features, then workup is not necessary, and focus is
    on treatment

Management

- NSAIDs and Tylenol for infrequent headaches, but consistent use
    (\>2-3 a week) runs the risk of rebound headaches

- Triptans for migraine, but contraindicated in patients with CAD,
    uncontrolled HTN, previous stroke. They must be used within 6 hour
    of onset

<!-- -->

- There are theoretical concerns of serotonin syndrome when used with
    SSRI/SNRIs

<!-- -->

- Migraines:

<!-- -->

- “Migraine cocktail”: 1L fluid bolus, 4g Mg, IV Compazine(10mg) OR
    Phenergan(20mg) with Benadryl (25mg)

- 2<sup>nd</sup> line: Depakote 1000 mg IV, decadron 10mg IV , +/-
    toradol 30mg IV, flexeril 10mg PO

<!-- -->

- Cluster headache:

<!-- -->

- Triptans, high flow O2 (\>10 L), sometimes intranasal lidocaine if
    no arrhythmia history

Medication Overview:

- Abortive

<!-- -->

- Triptans (e.g. sumatriptan or rizatriptan)

    - Cannot be used more than 10 days/month

    - Avoid in pts with hypertension/CAD

<!-- -->

- Preventative

<!-- -->

- Amitriptyline: indicated for both migraine and tension-type. Helps
    with sleep and comorbid depression. Most common side effects (SE) =
    dry mouth, sedation

- Topiramate: has the best evidence among migraine meds. Can
    theoretically help with weight loss. Most common SE = sodas taste
    bad, sedation, parasthesias

- Propranolol: useful for relative lack of interactions. Mild
    cardiac/blood pressure effects compared to other beta-blockers. Most
    common SE = drowsiness

- Magnesium oxide: reduces headache frequency with almost no SE. Start
    400mg daily, can go up to 800mg BID. Patients can increase dose
    until they get diarrhea.

- Riboflavin (vitamin B2): mild effect but effectively has no side
    effects. 400mg daily.

- Gabapentin: can be useful if HAs have stabbing/electric quality.
    Main SE = sedation

- Venlafaxine: useful for migraines with significant vestibular
    symptoms (dizziness). SE = hypertension/tachycardia.

- Verapamil: can be used for migraine and cluster headaches. Can use
    ER formulation

- Botox: can be administered every 3 months. Can be very effective,
    but pts generally will have had to fail multiple medications for
    insurance to approve refer to neuro resident clinic

- CGRP receptor modulators (mostly injections) such as Rimegepant are
    newer options

Parkinson’s Disease

Clinical Presentation

- Resting tremor is typically a very early symptom, often worse on one
    side

- Cogwheel rigidity; can be confused for paratonia, which is seen in
    demented or encephalopathic patients who have involuntary variable
    resistance movements during passive ROM assessment

- Speech changes (low volume), hand-writing changes (slow small
    movements)

- Gait changes

<!-- -->

- Festination – slow start with movements that gradually build up
    speed

- En bloc turning – taking multiple steps to turn around

<!-- -->

- Anosmia and REM behavior sleep disorders are very common

Evaluation

- Clinical diagnosis; there are some supportive imaging studies like
    DaTscan that looks for activity of substantia nigra (usually not
    necessary)

- Clinical response to dopamine replacement is so typical that if a
    patient does not respond, it is important to consider a Parkinson
    plus syndrome (see below)

Management

- Dopamine replacement – carbidopa/levodopa; dosed at regular
    intervals several times a day. These generally do not need to be
    held on admission.

<!-- -->

- If pt is altered, can hold anticholinergics, MAO-B inhibitors or
    COMT inhibitors

<!-- -->

- Dopamine agonists – can cause confusion, hallucinations, dyskinesias

- MAO-B inhibitors (MAOIs): can cause confusion, hallucinations,
    insomnia and dyskinesias

- COMT inhibitors – can cause confusion, hallucinations, insomnia, and
    dyskinesias

- Anticholinergics – useful for tremor when there is not much
    bradykinesia or gait disturbances. In older pts cognitive changes
    are a bigger concern along with hallucinations

- PD medications are rarely titrated in the hospital because acute
    medical illness makes PD symptoms worse and everything will need to
    be re-adjusted as an outpatient

- Be cautious with PRN anti-emetics in patients with PD. Many work via
    dopamine antagonism. Zofran is generally the safest option.

- Similarly, many antipsychotics have dopamine antagonism. Safest
    option is seroquel

Parkinson Plus Syndromes

Evaluation

- Consider if atypical features such as bilateral symmetric onset,
    early cognitive/personality changes, cerebellar findings, or
    prominent autonomic dysfunction early

Types

- Progressive Supranuclear Palsy

<!-- -->

- PD symptoms with early falls and minimal tremor

- Vertical eye movement abnormalities

<!-- -->

- Multisystem Atrophy

<!-- -->

- Profound orthostatic hypotension without any increase in HR

- Three types:

    - MSA-A – autonomic features prominent (previously Shy-Drager
        Syndrome)

    - MSA-P – prominent atypical Parkinsonism features

    - MSA-C – prominent cerebellar dysfunction

<!-- -->

- Lewy Body Dementia

<!-- -->

- Parkinsonism with prominent early cognitive impairment and
    hallucinations

Brain Masses

Background

- Neoplasm is the biggest concern

<!-- -->

- 90% of malignant brain masses are metastatic

    - Most commonly: lung, RCC, breast, melanoma

    - Highest bleeding risk: melanoma, thyroid, choriocarcinoma, RCC

- Primary brain tumors

    - Gliomas: WHO Grade I-IV

        - Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) – WHO Grade IV; large
            heterogenous masses with edema; heterogenous contrast
            enhancement; can cross the corpus callosum

        - Lower grade gliomas – include oligodendrogliomas and
            astrocytomas

    - Meningioma: usually low grade

        - Can be left alone and monitored with yearly MRI

        - If symptomatic, may need resection/radiation

    - Ependymoma: uncommon. Can cause CSF outflow obstruction

    - CNS lymphoma – diffuse WM involvement, with mass effect,
        restricts diffusion on MRI with prominent contrast enhancement.
        Can also cross the corpus callosum

        - Usually B-cell, initially responds significantly to steroids

Presentation

- A significant number of brain lesions are detected incidentally

- If a patient has a first-time seizure, brain mass needs to be ruled
    out

- HA (usually constant, severe), seizure, and focal neurologic
    deficits

Evaluation/Management

- Imaging: MRI w/ and w/o contrast provides the most information

<!-- -->

- Findings suggesting malignant lesions: marked edema, multifocal
    lesions, or presence at gray-white junctions

<!-- -->

- LP may be indicated if herniation risk is low, particularly if
    concerned for infection

- Biopsy will ultimately be needed in most cases, which is done by
    NSGY

Management

- Work up for primary malignancy, CT C/A/P + PET

- Steroids are generally indicated for treatment of edema

<!-- -->

- Decadron 10 mg IV to start; then transition to 4mg IV q6h with SSI

<!-- -->

- Symptomatic tumors need eval by NSGY for resection consideration and
    radiation oncology

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)

Background

- Progressive weakness, often asymmetric and profound with no sensory
    loss

- Combination of LMN and UMN findings

<!-- -->

- LMN findings: weakness, flaccidity, absent/decreased reflexes,
    fasciculations

- UMN findings: weakness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, pathologic
    reflexes (e.g. extensor plantar response), slow movements

<!-- -->

- Pts with bulbar symptoms may complain of difficulty swallowing,
    changes in their voice, or increased saliva production (they just
    aren’t swallowing it)

- Tongue fasciculations are fairly uncommon in other disorders and is
    a good clue for ALS if present (these can be hard to be certain of –
    tongue movements that are symmetric are typically not
    fasciculations)

- Pseudobulbar affect – inappropriate laughing or crying; relatively
    common in ALS

- FVC is an important marker for function

Evaluation

- EMG/NCS is gold standard; El Escorial Criteria looks for evidence of
    UMN and LMN findings at cranial, cervical, thoracic and lumbosacral
    levels to determine if ALS or not

- Exclude mimicking lesions, which may be treatable (see below)

Management

- Patients with ALS are ideally treated with a multidisciplinary team
    of Neurologists, Pulmonologists, Speech therapists, PT, OT and
    mobility

- Two medications have been shown to add a few months to survival:

<!-- -->

- Riluzole - PO med; have to track CBC/LFTs. Side effects: GI and
    general weakness

- Edaravone (Radicava) – IV, given daily for 2 weeks every month. SE =
    HA, bruising

Mimics of ALS

- High cervical spine lesions –UMN changes in upper extremity with LMN
    pattern in LE

- Primary Lateral Sclerosis – UMN-only disease, much less common with
    much slower progression. Many transition to ALS in the first 1-2
    years, which then is likely a spectrum of the same disease

- Multifocal Motor Neuropathy – rare autoimmune disorder that looks
    like ALS with LMN signs only, responds to IVIG. Can have anti-GM1 Ab
    in blood. EMG/NCS pattern is different with conduction block

- Kennedy Disease – X-linked genetic disorder with progressive LMN
    pattern of weakness and endocrine disorders w/androgen resistance
    profile (gynecomastia, defective spermatogenesis)

- Inclusion Body Myositis – can be asymmetric with grip weakness and
    quadriceps weakness. Biopsy and atrophy pattern usually
    distinguishes it. CPK 500-800.

- Polymyositis/dermatomyositis – proximal weakness in arms/legs, CPK
    \> 1000, usually younger onset (30-40s), no UMN signs

Multiple Sclerosis

Background

- Progressive inflammatory disorder primarily manifesting with
    demyelination of the central white matter

- Optic neuritis and transverse myelitis (spinal cord lesion) are
    common presentations

- Generally develop over a few days; very uncommon to happen suddenly
    (e.g., patients will complain about a dark spot appearing in their
    vision that expands over several days)

Evaluation

- MRI w/ and w/o contrast can identify plaques and determine if they
    are more acute

<!-- -->

- “Active” MS plaque will enhance, and continues to for weeks (even
    after treatment)

<!-- -->

- Modified MacDonald Criteria: ≥3 characteristic demyelinating lesions
    (\>1 cm, periventricular, infratentorial (brainstem/cerebellum/cord)
    or juxtacortical in location) with evidence of separation in time
    (active and chronic)

- LP with studies for oligoclonal bands, IgG index, cell count and
    protein, anti-mog, anti-aqp4

Management

- Treat flares and optic neuritis with steroids

<!-- -->

- Speeds up recovery, but does not improve the degree of recovery

- Often dosing starts with methylpred 1g

<!-- -->

- If a patient with known MS has worsening symptoms that are not new,
    then recrudescence is the likely cause infectious/toxic/metabolic
    workup and imaging is needed

- There are several long-term medications; common side effects listed
    below:

<!-- -->

- Interferon (SQ injections) – flu-like symptoms, injection site
    reactions

- Glatiramer acetate (SQ) – injection site reactions

- Fingolimod (PO) – macular edema, liver injury, increased risk of
    skin cancer

- Teriflunomide (PO) – liver injury, hair loss, immunosuppression,
    teratogenic

- Dimethyl fumarate (PO) – GI side effects, lymphocytopenia, liver
    injury

- Natalizumab (IV) – PML concern, immunosuppression

- Ocrelizumab (IV) – contraindicated in active HBV infection, cannot
    give live vaccines

- Alemtuzumab (IV) – autoimmune disease, rash, headache

Neuromyelitis Optica and Spectrum Disorder

- Demyelinating disease due to Ab against aquaporin-4 (on
    oligodendrocytes)

- Classically causes optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive
    transverse myelitis

<!-- -->

- Can be more aggressive than MS

<!-- -->

- Diagnose with NMO antibodies and MS workup as above

- Treated with steroids, but in severe or refractory cases may require
    PLEX

Vertigo

Background

- Clinical Presentation

<!-- -->

- Sensation of the room spinning or moving, or themselves spinning or
    moving

- Must distinguish from orthostasis/presyncope via history

<!-- -->

- Causes: most easily differentiated based on chronicity and triggers
    rather than description of symptoms

<!-- -->

- BPPV - short duration, very positional, classically nystagmus is
    horizontal and torsional with the posterior canal being most
    commonly involved

- Vestibular neuronitis/labyrinthitis – typically follows URI or ear
    infections; often self-limited, but can be severe/prolonged, in
    which case it is treated with steroids

- Menière’s Disease – tinnitus and low range frequency hearing loss,
    generally progressive and treated with diuretics, meclizine and
    sometimes surgeries or intratympanic injections

- Endolymphatic Leak – usually following trauma or concussive blasts,
    requires ENT eval and management. Classically a loud sound will
    cause vertigo and nystagmus

- vertiginous migraine: usual migraine triggers, may have aura.
    Episodic nature and often positive family hx of migraine or even
    vertiginous migraine.

- Stroke – sudden onset, ask about vascular risk factors, rare cause
    of isolated vertigo

Evaluation/Management

- Careful exam of vertigo will be more helpful than random scans, but
    pt has to be symptomatic for exam to mean anything:

<!-- -->

- HINTS Battery – Head Impulse test, Nystagmus pattern, Test of skew

    - Central pattern – no corrective saccade, multidirectional
        nystagmus, skew present

    - Peripheral pattern – corrective saccade, unidirectional
        nystagmus, no skew present

- Dix-Hallpike Test

- Cerebellar testing: FNF, HKS, mirroring, gait

- Outpatient Vestibular function testing with ENT

<!-- -->

- Central patterns will need head and vessel imaging (looking for
    vertebral dissection or basilar clots)

<!-- -->

- Often, central vertigo is due to centrally acting medications

<!-- -->

- Peripheral causes are varied and often require eval by ENT as an
    outpatient

- Treatment with anticholinergics like meclizine or scopolamine is
    often helpful

- Vestibular therapy with OT is also very beneficial

Basic Eye Anatomy

- <u>Sclera</u> - White wall of the eye

- <u>Conjunctiva</u> - Translucent, vascularized tissue that covers
    the anterior sclera (bulbar conjunctiva) and lines the inner aspect
    of the eyelids (palpebral conjunctiva). When the eyes get “red,” it
    is usually the conjunctiva, and not the sclera, that is irritated
    (conjunctival vessels dilate).

- <u>Cornea</u> - Transparent, bubble-like structure in front of the
    eye.

- <u>Iris</u> - “colored” part of the eye that dilates and constricts
    the pupil to let in more or less light

- <u>Pupil</u> - the central hole in the iris

- <u>Anterior Chamber (AC)</u> - the space between the cornea and the
    iris

- <u>Aqueous Humor</u> - clear fluid that fills the anterior and
    posterior chambers, produced by the ciliary body. Nourishes the
    cornea. The balance of aqueous production and drainage dictates the
    intraocular pressure (IOP).

- <u>Iridocorneal angle (or just, the Angle)</u> - angle between the
    iris and the cornea and site of the Trabecular Meshwork, which
    drains aqueous humor from the anterior chamber into the ocular
    venous system.

- <u>Lens</u> - transparent structure located behind the iris that
    helps focus light onto the retina; also responsible for
    accommodation (focusing at near). Located behind the iris. A
    cataract is an opacification of the lens.

- <u>Ciliary body</u> - ring structure that sits behind the iris.
    Produces aqueous humor and suspends the Lens via filaments called
    Zonules.

- <u>Posterior chamber</u> - the space between the iris and the lens

- <u>Vitreous chamber</u> - the space between the lens and the retina

- <u>Vitreous humor</u> - thick, jelly-like transparent substance that
    fills the vitreous chamber

- <u>Retina</u> - tissue that lines the inner back wall of the eye,
    contains photoreceptors and interneurons that absorb light and
    convert it into visual electrochemical signals

- <u>Macula</u> - area of the retina responsible for central vision.
    The fovea is the center of the macula.

- <u>Choroid</u> - highly vascularized layer of tissue posterior to
    the retina

- <u>Optic disc</u> - head of the optic nerve; the optic nerve is
    composed of the axons of the retinal ganglion neurons, transmitting
    visual electrochemical signals from the retina to the brain.

- <u>Uvea</u> - iris + ciliary body + choroid. These 3 tissues are
    actually connected and collectively make up the vascular layer of
    the eye.

- <u>The Anterior segment</u> - all structures that make up the
    “front” of the eye, i.e., anterior to the vitreous chamber (cornea,
    iris, iridocorneal angle, lens, ciliary body, aqueous humor)

- <u>The Posterior segment</u> - all structures that make up the
    “back” of the eye, i.e., the vitreous chamber and all structures
    contained within it (vitreous humor, retina, choroid, optic nerve)

Taking a Good Ocular History

History of Present Illness:

- Duration/Onset/Timing of visual or eye symptoms

- Eye pain? Quality/Severity?

- Symptoms constant or intermittent?

- Has this happened to you before?

- Any flashes/floaters/curtains/veils coming down in your field of
    vision? Timing of these?

- Any associated systemic symptoms (nausea/vomiting, fever/chills,
    headaches, neurologic deficits)

Past Ocular History:

- Do you wear glasses? For distance or reading or both? Contact
    lenses?

- When was the last time you saw an eye doctor?

- History of eye surgeries?

- History of any other eye conditions? Cataracts, glaucoma, macular
    degeneration, diabetic retinopathy?

Family History:

- Family history of any eye diseases? Glaucoma, macular degeneration,
    diabetic retinopathy?

Social History:

Approach to Blurry Vision

<img src="output/media/image18.png"
style="width:3.63889in;height:2.69212in"
alt="A picture containing text Description automatically generated" />
Key Points:

- This flowchart is meant to serve as a guide. Bear in mind that there
    are always exceptions.

- Many ocular problems are not urgent and can be dealt with
    outpatient. Assessing the acuity of onset is the first step.

- In general, the top differential for blurry vision is Dry Eye,
    Cataract, or Uncorrected refractive error.

- If the symptoms are acute and just in one eye, it is more likely to
    be ocular and warrants further investigation (likely ophthalmology
    consult).

Approach to Double Vision (Diplopia)

<img src="output/media/image19.jpeg"
style="width:3.75in;height:1.18885in"
alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />

Key Points

- This flowchart is meant to serve as a guide. Bear in mind that there
    are always exceptions.

- Most important question to ask with any patient complaining of
    double vision is whether it goes away when covering one eye. If it
    does, then it is an ocular misalignment issue (= true binocular
    diplopia).

- If the diplopia is acute and constant, this requires more urgent
    evaluation than if intermittent.

- Look at the pupil and eye movements:

<!-- -->

- If the eye is dilated (“blown pupil”), abducted and infraducted
    (“down and out position”), and ptotic, this is classic for a
    complete CN3 palsy and requires immediate neuroimaging (e.g. CTA
    head) to rule out an enlarging aneurysm.

Approach to Flashes, Floaters, Spots

<img src="output/media/image20.jpeg"
style="width:3.74868in;height:1.86066in"
alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />Key Points

- This flowchart is meant to serve as a guide. Bear in mind that there
    are always exceptions.

- Scintillating or colorful lights/spots, especially if bilateral, are
    likely migrainous in nature.

- A patient may say they see a visual disturbance in the left eye,
    when in reality it is in the left visual field of both eyes
    (indicating that it is a neurological issue, e.g., migraine). Ask if
    the patient has tried closing one eye to see if the visual
    phenomenon is actually in one eye.

- Rapid onset of floaters, often preceded by a peripheral
    crescent-shaped light flash, is classic for posterior vitreous
    detachment. A black curtain or veil that comes down in the vision is
    classic for retinal detachment.

Approach to a Red Eye

When the conjunctiva is vasodilated, or “injected,” the eye looks red.
The more inflamed the conjunctiva, the angrier-looking the eye.

Differential for Red Eye:

- Dry Eye

<!-- -->

- Trace diffuse injection, blurry vision that fluctuates, gritty
    sensation, clears with blinking

<!-- -->

- Corneal abrasion / ulceration / exposure keratopathy

<!-- -->

- Unilateral, moderate to severe injection, may be diffuse or
    sectoral, pain, blurry vision, mucus discharge, history of poor
    blink rate, intubated/sedated status.

<!-- -->

- Subconjunctival hemorrhage

<!-- -->

- Patch of bright red, often with sharp borders. Due to rupture of
    conjunctival vessel. Whole conjunctiva can be involved and may be
    bright red. Looks scarier than it is. Common in patients on
    anticoagulation or after a Valsalva event (e.g., coughing). Will
    resolve spontaneously.

<!-- -->

- Allergic conjunctivitis

<!-- -->

- Chemosis, mild to moderate injection, blurry vision, very itchy,
    watery discharge, hx of allergies/atopy

<!-- -->

- Viral or Bacterial conjunctivitis

<!-- -->

- Moderate to severe injection, scattered subconjunctival hemorrhages
    or petechiae, itchy or burning/painful eyes. If viral, look for
    preauricular adenopathy or recent URI.

<!-- -->

- Acute angle closure glaucoma

<!-- -->

- Severe eye pain with nausea/vomiting, rock-hard eye, mid-dilated and
    fixed pupil, blurry vision

<!-- -->

- Uveitis/Episcleritis/Scleritis

<!-- -->

- Eye pain, perilimbal injection (“ciliary flush”), blurry vision, may
    have history of autoimmune disease. Episcleritis vs Scleritis can be
    difficult to discern. Scleritis may have a deeper, violaceous hue.

<!-- -->

- Endophthalmitis

<!-- -->

- Eye pain, history of trauma or eye surgery, severe vision loss,
    history of immunocompromise and systemic infection (if endogenous)

<!-- -->

- Carotid-cavernous fistula

<!-- -->

- Engorged and tortuous conjunctival vessels, recent history of
    trauma, resistance to retropulsion (pushing the globe back in)

Anisocoria

Background

- Anisocoria = unequal pupil size

- Constriction of the pupil is driven by parasympathetic innervation;
    Dilation by sympathetic innervation

- Physiological anisocoria = pupil sizes differ by \<1mm. Normal.

Conditions that can cause anisocoria:

- Benign episodic mydriasis

<!-- -->

- Intermittent episodes of pupillary dilation and possible association
    with migraine. No other significant neurologic or ocular symptoms
    present. Important to exclude other causes of mydriasis prior to
    this diagnosis.

<!-- -->

- Horner’s syndrome

<!-- -->

- Pupillary miosis + ipsilateral upper lid ptosis

- May be congenital or acquired

- Acquired causes include: trauma involving sympathetic pathway,
    carotid dissection, cavernous sinus pathology, stroke, neck or
    thoracic surgery, or Pancoast / mediastinal tumor (rare).

- If suspect new onset Horner’s, consider Neurology and Ophthalmology
    consult.

<!-- -->

- CN3 Palsy

<!-- -->

- Pupillary mydriasis (“blown pupil”) + adduction, supraduction,
    infraduction deficit, “down and out position”, upper lid ptosis.
    Must rule out a compressive lesion on CN3.

- If new onset, consider head imaging and Neurology and Ophthalmology
    consult

<!-- -->

- Medications (especially anticholinergics)

<!-- -->

- Commonly seen in young patients with scopolamine patches who forget
    to wash hands after handling the patch; dilation can last one day to
    a couple weeks.

<!-- -->

- Trauma

<!-- -->

- Damage to the iris sphincter after eye trauma can cause a dilated
    pupil that is poorly reactive to light.

<!-- -->

- Eye surgery

<!-- -->

- Patients who have undergone intraocular surgery (like cataract
    surgery) may have an irregularly shaped, less reactive, and slightly
    dilated pupil as compared to the other eye due to damage or
    stretching of the iris during the operation.

<!-- -->

- Infections

<!-- -->

- Viral infections and syphilis can cause parasympathetic denervation,
    resulting in a relatively mydriatic pupil that is poorly reactive to
    light. However, the accommodative pupillary response (i.e.,
    constriction at focusing on an object at near) may be intact.

- “Adie’s Tonic Pupil” = Idiopathic cause of parasympathetic
    denervation presenting similarly as above. However, viruses (HSV)
    are sometimes thought to be behind idiopathic cases.

<!-- -->

- Acute angle closure glaucoma

<!-- -->

- During an acute attack, the pupil may be mid-dilated and sluggish to
    light. However, patients will also have symptoms of acute angle
    closure (e.g., headaches, nausea/vomiting, eye pain, etc. See
    Glaucoma section for more info).

Conjunctivitis

Background and Presentation

- Allergic, viral, or bacterial cause

- All forms present with red and irritated conjunctiva

- In practice it can be difficult to distinguish between the types of
    conjunctivitis. However, these are rough guidelines:

<!-- -->

- Allergic: hx of allergies/atopy, bilateral, chemosis, watery/mucoid
    discharge, itchiness predominant symptom

- Viral: hx of recent URI or exposure, unilateral first then
    bilateral, itchy/burning, subconjunctival hemorrhages or petechiae,
    watery/mucoid discharge, tender preauricular lymph nodes

- Bacterial: itching less prominent, burning/aching/stabbing
    discomfort predominates, unilateral first then bilateral,
    mucoid/purulent discharge (and more copious)

<!-- -->

- Blurry vision is common, but loss of vision should not occur if
    disease limited to conjunctiva.

Management:

- Allergic: eliminate allergen, artificial tears,
    antihistamine/mast-cell stabilizer drops (olopatadine, ketotifen),
    oral antihistamine (diphenhydramine, loratadine)

- Viral: 4-8x/day artificial tears, cold compresses, isolation
    precautions.

- Bacterial: culture/swab the ocular discharge, isolation precautions,
    moxifloxacin drops (Vigamox) QID or trimethoprim/polymyxin B
    drops/ointment for 5-7 days

- Consult ophthalmology if concern for worsening

Corneal Abrasion, Exposure Keratopathy, Ulceration

Background

- Corneal abrasion = corneal epithelial defect (KED): an area of
    missing corneal epithelium. This is akin to a scratch on the skin.
    Most common causes include trauma, excessive surface dryness,
    infection, and neurotrophic disease

- Exposure keratopathy = development of corneal epithelial defects
    secondary to incomplete closure of the eyelids (i.e., prolonged
    exposure of the cornea to air). Most often occurs in patients who
    are intubated/sedated, have poor orbicularis tone/paralysis (Bell
    palsy), or have abnormal blink rate (e.g., Parkinson’s).

- Corneal ulceration = the injury extends past the corneal epithelium
    and ‘ulcerates’ into the underlying stroma. Ulcerations are often
    infectious and develop after untreated abrasions (abrasions are
    essentially open wounds). In rare cases ulcerations can also be
    sterile (autoimmune/inflammatory).

Presentation and Evaluation

- Abrasions and ulcerations are often extremely painful. May be
    exacerbated by blinking.

- Conjunctival injection; but sometimes the eye can appear normal, or
    only have trace redness, and the pain may seem out of proportion to
    external appearance.

- Mucus discharge /crusting

- Photophobia and tearing

- Blurry vision

- Ulcerations will present with the above, but also have a whitish
    infiltrate in the cornea. The conjunctival injection and discharge
    will often be a lot worse.

- 1 drop of Proparacaine 0.5% will improve pain

<!-- -->

- Note: Proparacaine is used only for diagnostic, and not therapeutic,
    purposes. Do not administer proparacaine on a scheduled or PRN basis
    for pain. The duration of action is only 15 minutes, and repeated
    chronic use can lead to corneal melt/ulceration.

<!-- -->

- 1 drop of Fluorescein followed by shining a blue light (or Wood’s
    lamp) will reveal the KED.

Management

- VUMC Perioperative Corneal Abrasion Protocol

<!-- -->

- If patient is recently postop, or underwent recent extubation, and
    presents with eye pain/burning, blurry vision, redness, photophobia,
    VUMC has a periop corneal abrasion protocol (do not place
    ophthalmology consult):

    - Erythromycin ophthalmic ointment TID into the lower fornix of
        eye x5 days

    - If the pain and redness do not improve within 48 hours, then
        consult ophthalmology

<!-- -->

- Corneal Abrasion

<!-- -->

- If patient’s signs and symptoms are consistent with a corneal
    abrasion, try erythromycin ophthalmic ointment TID as above.

- If the pain and redness do not improve within 48 hours, or have
    other concerns, consult ophthalmology

<!-- -->

- Exposure Keratopathy

<!-- -->

- If patient is intubated and sedated, or cannot otherwise fully close
    his/her eyes, take the following measures to prevent development of
    corneal abrasion or ulceration:

    - Moisture chambers (aka bubble shields) to eyes at all times

    - Copious amount of lubricating ophthalmic ointment (e.g.,
        Lubrifresh) in eyes TID

<!-- -->

- Corneal Ulceration

<!-- -->

- If you see whitish material in the cornea itself, this is likely a
    corneal ulceration and warrants an ophthalmology consult.

Cataracts

Background

- Opacification of the eye’s natural lens

- Primary cause is normal aging, occurs bilaterally and symmetrically

- Other causes include congenital, trauma, and medications (esp
    chronic / long-term steroid use

Presentation

- Most common symptoms include progressive decreased vision over
    years, increased glare, increased difficulty with night vision

Evaluation and Management

- Unless the cataracts are dense enough, it is difficult to appreciate
    without a slit lamp exam

- Please place an outpatient referral.

Dry Eye

Background

- Most common ocular complaint, especially amongst patients admitted
    to the hospital!

- Due to insufficient tear production and/or imbalance in the
    components that make up the tear film

- Etiology is vast and can include aging, eye strain/overuse, contact
    lens use, systemic and topical medications, post eye surgery,
    nutritional deficiencies, autoimmune disease, or concomitant with
    other ocular conditions.

Presentation

- Blurry vision bilaterally that comes and goes (very common–if the
    patient complains of fluctuating blurriness, Dry Eye should be at
    the top of your differential!)

- Excessive tearing /watery eyes

- Stinging, burning, soreness, discomfort, gritty/foreign body
    sensation

- Discomfort with eye movements

- Trace/mild conjunctival injection

Evaluation and Management

- If a patient's symptoms sound like Dry Eye, order some
    preservative-free (PF) artificial tears at least 4x/day and
    lubricating eye ointment at bedtime to see if the patient's symptoms
    improve.

<!-- -->

- Polyvinyl alcohol-povidone PF (Refresh Classic)

- Lubricating ophthalmic ointment (Lubrifresh)

<!-- -->

- Order them SCHEDULED. Do not order these eye drops PRN (patients
    will not ask for them).

- If a patient's symptoms fail to improve or worsen on artificial
    tears, consider paging ophthalmology for additional assistance. If
    there is no apparent imminent threat to vision, you can place an
    ophthalmology outpatient referral upon discharge.

Fungemia and Intraocular Involvement

The American Academy of Ophthalmology currently does NOT recommend
routine Ophthalmology consults for visually asymptomatic patients with
systemic candidemia. The incidence of candidemia-related endophthalmitis
detected from routine screenings is \<1%.

By contrast, if the patient has visual symptoms, an Ophthalmology
consult is warranted.

- Breazzano MP et al. American Academy of Ophthalmology
    Recommendations on Screening for Endogenous Candida Endophthalmitis.
    Ophthalmology. 2022 Jan;129(1):73-76.

Giant Cell Arteritis: Role of Ophthalmology

If a patient has systemic symptoms suspect of GCA (see “Rheumatology
section”), when is it appropriate to consult Ophthalmology?

- If patient HAS visual symptoms (acute vision loss, new onset
    diplopia), consult ophthalmology.

- If patient DOES NOT have visual symptoms, DO NOT consult
    ophthalmology (e.g., to rule out “retinal vasculitis.”)

- It is extremely unlikely that Ophthalmology will find a pertinent
    ocular finding in the absence of visual symptoms to support a
    diagnosis of GCA.

- Bottom line: If you suspect GCA given the other systemic symptoms
    (regardless of visual status), treat promptly with high dose
    steroids!

- Temporal Artery biopsies are typically performed by Vascular
    Surgery.

Glaucoma

Background

- Glaucoma is a disease of the optic nerve that follows a
    characteristic pattern of optic nerve fiber degeneration.

- High intraocular pressure (IOP) is believed to be the main etiology
    of the disease.

- While the “normal” IOP range is between 11 and 21 mmHg, there are
    individuals who have a pressure above 21 that do NOT develop
    glaucoma. Conversely, there are individuals who have a pressure in
    the normal range that DO develop glaucoma (= Normal Tension
    Glaucoma).

- Aqueous humor fills the anterior chamber and drains through a
    sieve-like structure called the trabecular meshwork (TM), located in
    the angle between the iris and the cornea. After passing through TM,
    aqueous drains into the eye’s venous system. Impediment to aqueous
    flow will cause elevated IOP.

Presentation

- All glaucomas generally cause progressive peripheral visual field
    loss that ultimately encroaches on central fixation and leads to
    irreversible blindness if left untreated.

- A glaucomatous optic nerve is often described as “cupped”

- Presents in an acute or chronic fashion:

<!-- -->

- Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma

    - The iridocorneal angle rapidly closes, blocking aqueous drainage
        and causing a sudden rise in IOP (usually \>40mmHg).

    - Symptoms and Signs: intense eye or orbital pain, headache,
        nausea/vomiting, blurred vision, halos around lights, fixed and
        mid-dilated pupil, rock-hard eye, conjunctival redness, cloudy
        cornea.

    - Usually unilateral, but occasionally can be bilateral.

    - Classic trigger is a pupil-dilating factor (e.g., dark
        environment or anticholinergic medications) in a person with
        anatomically narrow angles.

    - If IOP is not lowered within hours, permanent optic nerve damage
        and vision loss will likely occur.

- Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG)

    - The iridocorneal angle is open, but due to inadequately
        functioning TM (or other mechanism) aqueous does not drain
        properly and IOP is chronically elevated.

    - POAG is often painless and without noticeable vision changes in
        the early stage of disease. Individuals can go undiagnosed for
        years, sitting at an IOP of say 30mmHg, without being aware they
        are losing vision until the vision loss is severe.

    - POAG is the most common glaucoma in the US. When a patient says
        they have a history of glaucoma, they probably have POAG.

Evaluation and Management

- Primary Open Angle:

<!-- -->

- Continue the patient’s home glaucoma drops; caution if they develop
    a medical condition that results in a contraindication (See table
    below)

- No need to officially place an Ophthalmology consult to order a
    patient’s home glaucoma drops; feel free to page Ophthalmology if
    you have questions.

- Pro tip: Often patients will remember the cap color of the drops
    they take but not the names!

- Acute Angle Closure:

<!-- -->

- If suspect acute angle closure given the signs described above,
    consult Ophthalmology ASAP.

- The goal is to lower the IOP ASAP. Target is \<30mmHg.

- Administer frequent rotating rounds of all the IOP-lowering drops: 1
    drop of Cosopt (then wait 5 minutes), followed by Brimonidine (then
    wait 5 minutes), followed by Latanoprost (then wait 5 minutes)--then
    keep repeating the cycle until the IOP goes down.

- Concurrently, administer one dose of IV Diamox 500mg if not
    contraindicated (e.g., renal insufficiency or hepatic cirrhosis).
    Ophthalmology will recheck the IOP every hour or so to ensure that
    the IOP is responding (usually it does).

- If the IOP does not respond, patient will need a bedside AC tap to
    offload aqueous and lower the pressure.

- Patient should ultimately get a Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI) to
    avoid future angle-closure attacks, which is typically performed as
    an outpatient procedure.

Orbital vs Preseptal Cellulitis

Background

- The septum is a fibrous, membranous structure that divides the
    anterior from the posterior orbit.

- Preseptal cellulitis = infection is bound anterior to the septum

- Orbital cellulitis (AKA postseptal cellulitis) = infection extends
    posterior to the septum

- Common risk factors/etiologies: URI, acute or chronic sinusitis,
    trauma, tooth abscess, stye or other local/adjacent skin
    infection/condition, local/adjacent bug bite, immunocompromised
    state, underlying systemic infection

- Often bacterial cause (gram positive Staph or Strep species, and/or
    gram negative anaerobic species like Peptococcus or Bacteroides).
    Consider fungal infection (Aspergillus, Mucor) in immunocompromised
    or diabetic patients.

Evaluation

- Vital signs

- Labs: CBC, CMP, ESR, CRP, blood cultures, wound culture if any open
    draining areas

- Imaging: CT orbits with and without contrast

- Daily or BID photographs to track progression

- You can use the LRINEC scale to help assess whether the infection is
    necrotizing:

- https://www.mdcalc.com/lrinec-score-necrotizing-soft-tissue-infection.
    Necrotizing soft tissue infections should be addressed immediately
    and undergo surgical debridement ASAP.

Management

- Preseptal cellulitis can usually be managed on an outpatient basis
    with PO antibiotics (e.g. augmentin) with close followup.

- However, if condition is worsening, if there is failure to improve
    on PO antibiotics, or if concerned for postseptal extension (i.e.,
    that the preseptal cellulitis has evolved into an orbital
    cellulitis), management generally includes:

<!-- -->

- IV broad spectrum antibiotics (usually Unasyn + Vancomycin to start
    if no intracranial extension; could also do Vancomycin +
    Ceftriaxone + Flagyl)

- Ophthalmology Consult

- Consider ID consult

- Consider ENT consult if concomitant sinus disease (most of the time
    there is)

- Consider OMFS consult if suspect etiology is odontogenic

- Tobradex eye drops QID to affected eye

- Nasal toilet (afrin, flonase, nasal saline)--usually dictated by ENT

- Warm compresses at least QID to affected eye

- Trend daily CRP

<!-- -->

- If there is failure to improve on the above regimen, a large orbital
    abscess, optic nerve stretch on CT scan, evidence of necrotizing
    infection, or visual compromise, the patient may need to undergo
    surgical drainage.

Optic Neuritis

Background

- Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve. Often caused by
    demyelinating disease (e.g., Multiple sclerosis). Less often, can be
    caused by infection (viral etiology, bartonella, Lyme, syphilis, TB,
    toxoplasmosis) or infiltrative process (e.g., sarcoidosis,
    malignancy).

Presentation

- Symptoms include scotoma, constant blurry vision or blurred spot,
    pain with eye movements, along with other systemic neurologic
    symptoms (if demyelinating process)

- If patient is of age 20s-40s and female, autoimmune/demyelinating
    disease is at top of the differential

- If patient is older, consider other causes

- If patient is immunocompromised, infectious etiology becomes more
    likely

Evaluation

- Consult both Ophthalmology and Neurology if concerned for an optic
    neuritis

- MRI brain and orbits with and without contrast, thin slices, fat
    suppression

- If no contraindications to imaging, obtain LP with CSF studies
    (glucose, protein, cell count, Gram stain, bacterial/viral cultures,
    RPR/VDRL, oligos, consider NMO/AQP4)

Management

- High dose IV methylprednisolone

- If vision continues to worsen and/or presence of other systemic
    neurologic symptoms despite steroid treatment, consider escalation
    to PLEX therapy with assistance of neurology

Papilledema

Background

- Papilledema refers to edema of the optic nerve due to increased
    intracranial pressure

- Ophthalmology is often consulted to rule out papilledema in patients
    who fit the “Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)” profile, or
    with patients with other reasons for high ICP

Presentation

- Symptoms of increased ICP: headaches that vary with position (often
    worse with bending over), nausea, vomiting, neck
    stiffness/meningismus, pulsatile tinnitus, fevers/chills

- Visual symptoms of papilledema: transient visual obscurations,
    dimming of vision, blurry vision, loss of color vision/red
    desaturation, loss of peripheral vision, scotoma.

Evaluation and Management

- Consult Ophthalmology and Neurology if concerned for papilledema.
    Neurosurgery should be involved if there is concern for shunt
    failure or other neurosurgical problem.

- Ophthalmology / Neurology will advise on what imaging to order
    (usually MRI / MRV brain with and without contrast, + MRI Orbits
    with and without contrast and fat suppression)

- If no contraindications after imaging, obtain LP with opening
    pressure, with CSF sent for cells, protein, glucose, and
    infectious/neoplastic workup where appropriate

- Ophthalmology / Neurology may recommend initiation of PO or IV
    acetazolamide (Diamox). These may be contraindicated or need to be
    renally dosed if the patient has chronic kidney disease.

Retinal Detachment and Posterior Vitreous Detachment

Background

- Retinal detachment (RD) = detachment of retinal tissue from the back
    of the eye. Risk factors include trauma, high myopia
    (nearsightedness), older age, history of RD in the other eye, prior
    eye surgery, and family history.

- Posterior Vitreous Detachment (PVD) = detachment of vitreous (jelly)
    from the retina. PVDs eventually will happen to all adults as the
    vitreous liquefies and shrivels with age. Some are asymptomatic.

- PVDs can lead to RDs, but not always. As the vitreous peels away
    from the underlying retina, vitreous can pull a piece of retina with
    it, causing a retinal tear. The retinal tear, if not treated, can
    evolve into an RD.

Presentation and Evaluation

- Both can present with acute flashes and floaters

- However, RDs will often present with a black curtain or veil that
    comes down somewhere in the patient’s field of vision. PVDs may
    result in blurriness, but will not present with veils, scotomas, or
    severe loss of vision.

Management

- If patient presents with acute flashes, floaters, and/or black
    curtains in field of vision in one eye, consult ophthalmology.

- If not acute, or if symptoms occur in both eyes simultaneously,
    chances are this is not a PVD or an RD. See Approach to Flashes,
    Floaters, Spots.

Uveitis (includes Iritis, Cyclitis, Retinitis, Choroiditis)

Background

- ”Uvea” = iris + ciliary body + choroid (these 3 tissues are
    connected and make up the vascular layer of the eye)

- Uveitis = inflammation of either or all of these structures.
    However, “uveitis” is a bit of a misnomer, since it is used to
    denote inflammation of any ocular component

- Uveitis is usually associated with autoimmune conditions, but
    infections can also cause uveitis.

Management

- If you suspect a patient has uveitis, consult ophthalmology for
    evaluation.

- Patients with any of the above associated systemic conditions (e.g.,
    IBD) do not need an inpatient Ophthalmology consult unless the
    patient has visual symptoms. Referral to outpatient Ophthalmology is
    appropriate for routine screening.

Wilson’s Disease: Ophthalmic Manifestations

- The two classic ophthalmic manifestations of Wilson’s disease are
    the “Kayser-Fleischer ring” (copper deposition around the corneal
    limbus) and the “Sunflower cataract” (copper deposition in the
    lens).

- Wilson’s disease rarely affects vision (unless the sunflower
    cataract is very advanced).

- Unless the disease is very advanced/has been present for years, it
    is impossible for one to detect subtle copper deposition in the
    cornea, iridocorneal angle, or lens without an office-based slit
    lamp exam and gonioscopy (only available in the outpatient setting).

<!-- -->

- Furthermore, the presence or absence of a Kayser-Fleischer ring does
    not rule in or rule out the disease

- Testing for decreased ceruloplasmin, urinary copper levels, and
    genetic testing are more effective diagnostic methods.

<!-- -->

- If concerned about the visual impact of a developing sunflower
    cataract, an outpatient ophthalmology referral is appropriate.

    (lipid pnl q3-12 months)

- Dot phrase: .ASCVD2013

Evaluation

- Fasting vs Non-Fasting Lipid Panel

<!-- -->

- Triglycerides are most impacted by non-fasting testing which can
    artificially lower LDL-C depending on how the laboratory
    measures/calculates LDL. Consider fasting lipid panels when
    triglyceride levels are high

<!-- -->

- Consider 2º causes of HLD in initial workup: hypothyroidism, DM,
    EtOH use, smoking, liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, CKD, meds
    (e.g., thiazide, glucocorticoids)

Management

- Lifestyle changes:

<!-- -->

- Heart Healthy Diet: ↓ trans/saturated fats, choose skim milk,
    low-fat dairy products

- Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, poultry, fish, nuts and
    olive oil, while limiting red and processed meats, sodium and
    sugar-sweetened foods and beverages

- Promote a healthy weight, regular exercise, smoking cessation, limit
    EtOH

Statin Therapy

- Initiate as outlined in the following algorithms

- Check AST/ALT prior to initiation

- Note that PCE used to estimate ASCVD risk is best validated for
    non-Hispanic whites and blacks. Consider use of additional risk
    prediction tools/factors in other patient populations

Statin Options

Statin Side effects:

- Spectrum of statin associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) include
    myalgias, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, autoimmune myopathy

<!-- -->

- Myalgias: bilateral involving large muscle groups, onset within
    weeks of initiation of therapy and should resolve within weeks of
    cessation; CK should be normal

- Consider evaluation with CK, BMP, TSH, and vitamin D

- ACC has a “Statin Intolerance Calculator” to help assess etiology of
    symptoms

Additional Information

- If patient is not tolerating a statin, consider:

<!-- -->

- Holding statin until symptoms resolve and trialing lower dose or
    alternative statin (Pravastatin and Fluvastatin may have lower risks
    of myopathy)

- Every other day dosing with atorvastatin and rosuvastatin (longer
    half-lives)

<!-- -->

- If repeated failed attempts, consider alternative agents: Ezetimibe,
    PCSK9 inhibitor

- PCSK9 inhibitor requires referral to Lipid Clinic

Hypertriglyceridemia:

- Moderate: TG 175-499 mg/dL; Moderate-severe 500 - 999; Severe: TG \>
    1000

- Focus on addressing lifestyle factors and stopping medication that
    increase TG’s (HCTZ, some BB’s, estrogens, some ART, antipsychotics)

- Consider medical therapy when TG\> 500mg/dL (increased risk of
    pancreatitis):

<!-- -->

- Omega-3-fatty acids (icosapent ethyl) 4gms daily or Vascepa 4gm
    daily

- Fibrates: Fenofibrate 120 mg daily (avoid in CKD), Gemfibrozil 600mg
    bid (increased risk of myopathy with concomitant statin)

VA- Specific Guidelines

- <https://www.healthquality.va.gov/guidelines/cd/lipids/index.asp>

Hypertension (HTN) – Daniel Motta-Calderon

Background

- Elevated systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure are
    associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk

- HTN is the most prevalent modifiable risk factor for premature CVD

Definitions

- ACC/AHA definition of HTN: taking antihypertensive medication or
    having a systolic pressure ≥130 mmHg and/or a diastolic pressure ≥80
    mmHg

- Resistant HTN**:** Uncontrolled BP despite taking 3 antihypertensive
    medications including a diuretic OR 4 total medications

- Whitecoat HTN: Mean BPs lower than threshold of HTN based on
    out-of-office measurements (falsely elevated measurements during
    visits). If SBP \> 130 but \< 160, consider screening for white coat
    HTN with home monitoring

- Masked HTN: Mean BP at/above threshold for hypertension based upon
    out-of-office measurements (falsely decreased measurements during
    visits). If office SBPs consistently 120-129, consider screening for
    masked HTN with home monitoring

    Screening

- Grade A USPTF rec: Screen all adults \>18. Screen adults at least
    semiannually if have risk factors for HTN (obesity, AA), or if
    previously measured SBP 120-129

Diagnosis

- Proper BP measurement:  legs uncrossed, supported arm at level of
    heart, after 5 minutes of rest and with empty bladder; avoid
    caffeine or tobacco 30 minutes prior

- Ideally, primary detection in clinical setting (BP ≥130/80) followed
    by confirmation with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM): 

<!-- -->

- 24hrs mean of systolic ≥125 or diastolic ≥75mmHg 

- Daytime mean systolic ≥130mmHg or diastolic ≥80mmHg  

- Nighttime mean systolic ≥110 mmHg or ≥65 diastolic mmHg 

<!-- -->

- If ABPM not possible, 2-3 outpatient measurements at 1-4 week
    intervals are required to confirm diagnosis  

- BP \>160/100mmHg in the outpatient setting with evidence of
    end-organ damage (ischemic CMP, CVA, hypertensive retinopathy, LV
    hypertrophy, CKD) 

- Any patient presenting with hypertensive emergency or severe
    asymptomatic hypertension (\>180/120mmHg) 

Evaluation

- Assess target organ damage as pertinent: CVA, retinopathy, LV
    hypertrophy/dysfunction, HF, CAD, CKD, PAD.  

<!-- -->

- BMP, CBC, lipid panel, UA, TSH, EKG. Consider additional testing
    including TTE, urine Alb:Cr ratio, or uric acid, ABI 

- Calculate ACSVD 10y risk

<!-- -->

- Distinguish between primary (90% incidence) and secondary HTN
    (10%): 

<!-- -->

- Suspect 1º if gradual onset, family hx, associated with weight gain
    & lifestyle factors 

- Suspect 2º if drug-resistant, abrupt onset, onset \<30yo,
    exacerbation of previously controlled HTN, onset of diastolic
    hypertension in older adults \>65yo, unprovoked or excessive
    hypokalemia

| Elevated BP                                       | systolic 120-129 mmHg AND diastolic \<80 mmHg | Non-pharmacological interventions and reassess in 3-6 months                                                                      |
| Stage 1                                           | systolic 130-139 mmHg OR diastolic 80-89 mmHg | If 10-y CVD risk ≥10%, non-pharm intervention + BP-lowering medication. Reassess monthly until BP goal met, then every 3-6 months |
| Stage 2                                           | systolic ≥140 mmHg OR diastolic ≥90 mmHg      | Non-pharmacological intervention + BP lowering medication. Reassess monthly until BP goal met, then every 3-6 months              |

Non-pharmacological interventions: regardless of stage  

- 8-14 mmHg ↓: DASH diet (fresh produce, whole grains, low-fat dairy) 

- 5-10 mmHg ↓: Weight loss (10 kg or 22 lbs), expect 1mm Hg for every
    1kg reduction in body weight 

- 3-9 mmHg ↓: Na+ restriction (1.5 g / day), aerobic exercise for
    90-150 min/week, increased intake of K+ rich foods 

- 2-4 mmHg ↓: Moderate EtOH (2 drinks/day for men; 1 drink/day for
    women) 

- Consider deprescribing or switching amphetamines, antidepressants
    (MAOi, SNRIs, TCAs), atypical antipsychotics (clozapine,
    olanzapine), caffeine, decongestants (phenylephrine,
    pseudoephedrine), cyclosporine, oral contraceptives, NSAIDs,
    steroids

Pharmacologic therapy 

- Three main classes of drugs use for initial monotherapy for primary
    hypertension include: ACE-Is/ARBs, CCBs (most frequently a
    dihydropyridine), and thiazide diuretics

- Note that there is wide variability among patients as some will
    respond to one antihypertensive drug but not another

- Black patients often respond best to CCBs or thiazides

- Individualize therapy depending on comorbidities

effective, less side effects) 

- Preferred combinations 

<!-- -->

- ACEi/ARB + CCB 

- ACEi/ARB + CCB + thiazide. 

- ACEi/ARB + CCB + MRA 

- Do not combine beta-blockers with non-dihydropyridines.

Asthma – Jared Freitas

Background

- Typically diagnosed in childhood, but occupational asthma,
    aspirin-induced asthma and eosinophilic asthma are more commonly
    diagnosed in adults

- Three most common symptoms: wheezing after trigger, nighttime cough,
    and associated dyspnea

- COPD-asthma overlap syndromes: newer entity that typically involves
    intermittent symptoms

<!-- -->

- Obstruction is present but does not fully resolve with
    bronchodilator

- Consider this diagnosis in a pt w/significant smoking history who is
    dx’d with asthma at age \>40yo

Evaluation

- Ask about triggers: cold, exercise, URIs, allergens, inhaled
    irritants

- Ask about family history or personal history of atopy, eczema,
    allergic rhinitis

- Exam: wheezing, prolonged expiratory phase; nasal polyps, rhinitis,
    eczema

- Spirometry (PFT’s) with reversible obstruction

<!-- -->

- FEV1/FVC \<0.7; \# FEV1 12% and 200 mL after bronchodilator

<!-- -->

- “All That Wheezes Is Not Asthma”. Must rule out alternative
    diagnoses:

<!-- -->

- Panic attacks, upper airway obstruction, foreign body, vocal cord
    dysfunction, CHF (cardiac asthma), COPD, ILD

<!-- -->

- Consider CBC w/diff to screen for significant anemia and
    eosinophilia (associated w/allergic asthma or eosinophilic
    pneumonia)

- If concerned for allergic asthma or allergic bronchopulmonary
    aspergillosis, consider measuring total serum IgE levels

Classify Severity and Assess for Symptom Control with the RULE OF 2s:

- Does the patient have symptoms or require rescue inhaler ≥2 times
    per week?

- Does the patient endorse nighttime symptoms ≥ 2 times per month?

- Does the patient have to refill rescue inhaler ≥ 2 times per year?

- Does the patient ever have to limit activity due to asthma symptoms?

Initial Assessment of Severity:

- Intermittent: No to all of the above and FEV1\> 80% predicted. Start
    at step 1

- Persistent: Yes to any question above. Start at Step 2

<!-- -->

- Mild: Less than daily symptoms, less than weekly nighttime symptoms,
    minor limitation to activities. FEV \>80% predicted

- Moderate: Daily symptoms, weekly nighttime symptoms, some limitation
    to activities. FEV 60-80% predicted

- Severe: More severe symptoms than above, FEV1 \<60% predicted

    - Consider referral to pulmonary

Management

- Aim to use the lowest possible step to maintain symptom control.
    Also consider stepping down therapy if pt has been well-controlled
    for \>3 months

- Prior to escalating therapy, consider:

<!-- -->

- Adherence to therapy (including inhaler technique), uncontrolled
    comorbidities (allergies, GERD, OSA, etc), and alternative diagnoses

- Ensure patients receive MDI and spacer teaching for full effect

<!-- -->

- Updated Guidelines: prn ICS - LABA \> prn SABA Step 1 (mild
    intermittent) and Step 2 (mild persistent)

<!-- -->

- Reduces exacerbations, easier to schedule does in future if needed

- SYGMA Trial showed rescue/prn Budesonide-formoterol (ICS - LABA)
    non-inferior to daily ICS-LABA + prn SABA in preventing
    exacerbations

<!-- -->

- Follow-up

<!-- -->

- Repeat PFTs q3-6 mos after beginning therapy and q1-2 yrs thereafter

- Regular follow up at least q6 mos for all patients with asthma

VA specific guidance: 

- Mometasone is the formulary ICS and Wixela (fluticasone-salmeterol)
    is the formulary ICS/LABA

- Ordering PFTs: Refer to Pulm section on PFTs for VUMC and VA
    specifics

Approach to Outpatient Anxiety/Depression – Kunal Patel

Background

- Anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic
    disorder (PD), agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder (SAD), specific
    phobia

<!-- -->

- Some of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders

- Age of onset varies: SAD (\~teens), PD (\~20s), GAD (broad range,
    incl. \>50)

<!-- -->

- Depression: can refer to a mood state, syndrome, or mental disorder

<!-- -->

- 1-year prevalence of 10%; lifetime prevalence of 21%

- USPTF recommends screening for depression in the general adult
    population

- Average age of onset 30 years

- More common in females (2:1), younger adults, lower income patients,
    and those who are divorced, separated, or widowed

Evaluation

- Anxiety disorders

<!-- -->

- See table for features to elicit in history

- Labs (not all may be necessary): CBC, BMP, TSH, UA, EKG, UDS

<!-- -->

- Major depressive disorder (MDD)

<!-- -->

- See table for features to elicit in history

- Labs (not all may be necessary): CBC, BMP, TSH, RPR, hCG, UDS, B12,
    Folate, EKG

- Determine severity: mild, moderate, severe

    - Degree of functional impairment and disability

Management

- Anxiety

<!-- -->

- Psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy

<!-- -->

- Depression

<!-- -->

- Mild: psychotherapy and symptom monitoring

- Moderate: psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy

- Severe: psych consult, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy

Psychotherapy

- Cognitive behavioral therapy: identifying and modifying negative
    thoughts

- Behavioral activation: scheduling positive activities and increasing
    positive interactions

- Interpersonal psychotherapy: addressing interpersonal issues in
    structured manner

- Find with psychotherapists through VUMC behavioral health referral
    or psychologytoday.com

- VA specific: First refer to PCMHI (teams for same day assessment,
    otherwise consult) and then if needed to BHIP

Pharmacotherapy

- Good starting agents are SSRIs/SNRIs

- Choose based on patient’s specific symptoms, age, adverse effects,
    co-morbidities, and any potential drug-drug interactions

- Typically, start at low doses and titrate up every 2 weeks as needed
    until maximum dose reached

- Full effects not seen until 8-12 weeks, should wait this time before
    switching

- If no response, switch to another SSRI/SNRI

- If partial response, augment

<!-- -->

- Anxiety disorders: buspirone or gabapentin/pregabalin

- MDD: Addition of second agent from different class (e.g. bupropion)

Fatigue – Thomas Horton

Background

- 21-33% of primary care patients describe fatigue as an important
    problem (even if not CC)

- Obtain a thorough history and validate the patient's concerns

<!-- -->

- Assess impact on daily life and accommodations the patient has made
    to cope

<!-- -->

- Description of fatigue: mental vs. physical; sleepiness/tiredness
    vs. "low energy"

- Assess Chronicity: Acute \<1 month; subacute 1-6 months; Chronic \>6
    months

- Review medication list, age -elated cancer screening, prior lab
    values, imaging findings if applicable

- Brief Fatigue Inventory or Fatigue Assessment Scale can be used for
    quantification

Evaluation

- Complete physical exam

- Lab tests to order if \>1 month duration: CMP, CBC w/ diff, HIV,
    Hepatitis B/C, TSH

<!-- -->

- Autoimmune, inflammatory, pregnancy, CK, PPD tests *based on
    clinical context*

<!-- -->

- Assess for mood disorder (PHQ-9; GAD7)

- Assess for sleep disturbance (STOP-BANG, Epworth Sleepiness Scale)

- Age appropriate cancer screening if applicable

- Diagnostic imaging studies based on history and physical exam
    findings

- Screen for domestic violence, housing insecurity, substance use

Management

- Treatment is largely specific to underlying etiology of fatigue (if
    found)

- Etiology may never be identified

<!-- -->

- Consider diagnosis of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue
    syndrome (ME/CFS) if other causes have been ruled out

<!-- -->

- Continue a supportive relationship with patient

- Consider empiric trial of antidepressant therapy in those with
    residual/idiopathic fatigue with depressed mood even if patient does
    not meet MDD criteria

Chronic Rhinosinusitis – Jared Freitas

Background

- Inflammatory syndrome of the paranasal sinuses, with objective
    evidence of inflammation for \> 12 weeks, typically in young to
    middle aged adults

- Symptoms: typically need two of the following:

<!-- -->

- Anterior/posterior mucopurulent nasal drainage

- Presence of nasal fullness/congestion

- Facial pain/pressure, sometimes accompanied by headache (most
    prevalent but least specific)

- Reduction in sense of smell

<!-- -->

- Red flag symptoms that require more emergent evaluation by ENT or
    NSGY

<!-- -->

- Double vision

- Proptosis

- Ophthalmoplegia

- Severe headache

- Any focal neurologic deficits

<!-- -->

- In addition to clinical history, patients need objective evaluation
    with nasal endoscopy or non-contrasted CT of sinuses (gold standard
    imaging modality) to confirm presence of inflammation and presence
    of nasal polyps

- Other conditions to consider on differential:

<!-- -->

- Rhinitis without sinusitis (vasomotor, gustatory, allergic,
    idiopathic)

- Headache and facial pain syndromes

- Laryngopharyngeal reflux syndrome

Management

- Daily sinus rinses with saline can clear sinuses of secretions,
    irritants and allergens

- Utilizing daily intranasal corticosteroid sprays improve symptoms,
    better control when used in conjunction with sprays

- Short courses of macrolide antibiotics less than 3 weeks duration
    along with short course oral corticosteroids for acute exacerbations

- When to refer to specialist:

<!-- -->

- ENT: Refractory symptoms necessitating rhinoscopy to look for nasal
    polyps, anatomical source of obstruction, ability to get direct
    culture from sinuses, or for sinus surgery as treatment

- Allergy/immunology: treatment of causal allergen or associated
    immunodeficiency that contributes to recurrent infections

<!-- -->

- 10-14 days of oral corticosteroids can also help in patients with
    nasal polyps shrink inflamed tissue and decrease obstructive
    symptoms but require ongoing nasal steroids to prevent recurrence

- Daily antileukotriene agents and antihistamines can provide benefit
    in patients with an allergic component

    Smoking cessation can lead to symptom relief in CRS pts with and w/o
    nasal polyps

Palliative Care

Code Status Discussion – Katie Sunthankar

- The approach to obtaining someone’s code status should be thoughtful
    and pertinent to their current admission or recent change in
    clinical status

<!-- -->

- Ask yourself “Why would this patient code? Is resuscitation a
    reversible treatment in this patient’s case? What are the chances
    that this patient will survive to discharge following CPR? Is the
    anticipated outcome in line with the patient’s goals?

- After you have made your assessment, help patient make an educated
    decision based on both the efficacy of resuscitation and the
    patient’s goals

<!-- -->

- Below are examples of phrases that can be used in framing code
    status.

<!-- -->

- NEVER say “Do you want us to do everything?” Most patients will
    respond yes to this even if they do not want CPR

- It is more helpful to give examples of when these situations would
    arise and make recommendations based on your medical judgment
    factoring in patient's goals

Admitting a patient:

- **Introduction**: Normalize the conversation by stating “these are
    questions we routinely ask everyone when they come into the
    hospital. This is a way for us to understand your wishes in the
    event you are unable to make your own decisions.”

- **Surrogate**: “If you were unable to make decisions for yourself,
    who would you trust to make your decisions? The person you pick
    should be able to speak to your wishes and make the same choices you
    would make for yourself”

- \-**Intubation**: Always do this first so you can avoid the sticky
    DNI but not DNR situation. Again, normalize the question. “Everyone
    has different opinions on what types of medical care they would want
    if they became sicker. One of the things we like to talk about are
    ventilators or breathing machines. Some tell us to try a breathing
    machine for a trial, but they would not want to be kept alive on a
    ventilator.” Now make a recommendation. “In your case I think if you
    were to need a ventilator, I think it would \[work, not work,\]”
    Pause and allow them to ask questions. Also remember that if they
    say DNI, then they must be DNR because intubation occurs with ACLS
    (this is not allowed at VUMC. It is technically allowed at the VA if
    the patient specifically requests but would not recommend routinely
    providing this option)

- **CPR**: Prime this question with “The next question I have to ask
    you can be hard to think about, but it is important that we know
    what you would want in an emergency. Specifically, if you had a
    cardiac arrest where your heart stops beating and you die, would you
    want chest compressions to try and restart your heart? We know based
    on the evidence that CPR is not always successful. It really depends
    on the situation. In your case, I think CPR would be (make a
    recommendation here). Knowing this, would you want us to attempt CPR
    to resuscitate you?”

<!-- -->

- A helpful way to share data about the success of CPR: “Can I share
    some numbers about how often CPR can help?” Sometimes using fingers
    to show these numbers helps. “If you take 10 people in this hospital
    and all of their hearts stop beating, which would mean they have
    died, and we get to them as fast as possible, only 3 of them would
    have their hearts restarted and only 1 of them would ever leave the
    hospital.”

What if you do not think performing CPR Is medically appropriate?…

- At the end of the day, it is their decision (attendings may change
    the code status out of medical futility in Tennessee)

- Code status can be revisited throughout the hospital stay,
    especially if the patient was initially overwhelmed or if their
    clinical status evolves. Sometimes patients find it helpful to have
    a family member or friend present

- Consider framing the discussion differently and offer your
    recommendation: “While you are in the hospital, we will support you
    with interventions and medications that we think are helpful based
    on what you have told us important to you. However, we are worried
    that some of the interventions you are asking for may do more harm
    than good. Many people think that CPR works like it does on TV.
    Unfortunately, we know that most patients who need CPR in the
    hospital do not survive like they do on TV. In your case, we do not
    think it would bring you back to your current state. I worry that
    this is not something that will be helpful to you.”

- Another phrase that is helpful (and when the discussion occurs with
    surrogates leads to higher rates of changing code status than saying
    DNR): “allow for a natural death”. For example, “I worry that given
    how sick your \[loved one\] is, that the additional interventions of
    CPR if she were to die, would prevent her from having a natural
    death”

Conversion:

- Transition between opiates is done using oral morphine equivalents
    (OMEs). Each drugs’ potency is compared to oral morphine (see
    table). Ex: 1 mg IV morphine = 3 mg PO morphine

- When transitioning, doses are traditionally reduced by 1/4 to 1/3
    due to cross tolerance

- IR/ER regimens: Consider switching to extended release when
    requiring 3-4 doses of intermediate release (IR) medications in a
    24-hour period regularly. The ER medication should treat the chronic
    pain experienced by a patient. The IR preparation is indicated for
    breakthrough pain. The IR dose should be calculated as 10-20% of the
    total OME dose a patient takes daily. Fentanyl patches should last
    72 hours

Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCAs)

- Pumps can be programmed to deliver a continuous rate and/or a bolus
    dose

<!-- -->

- Basal rate = a continuous infusion dosed per hour that cannot be
    adjusted by the patient

- Demand dose = a patient-directed bolus that is given at a prescribed
    frequency whenever the pt presses the button. Both the dose and
    frequency can be adjusted

- The general rule of thumb is to calculate the total OME delivered
    through the demand when a pt is in steady state and convert 75% of
    this dose into the total continuous rate.

    Calculating initial doses:

<!-- -->

- Basal dose: check what the patient is actually taking at home (may
    be different than what is prescribed, use OME). Take the total daily
    dose and convert to IV and then divide that by 24 hours to get an
    hourly rate. If moderate pain, increase dose by 25-50%; if severe,
    by 50-100%

- Demand doses: The bolus dose should be 10-20% of total daily dose.
    The availability is based on half-life of the medication (2hr for
    IV). Adjust the availability based on how frequently you want
    patient to be able to have a demand dose (ex: if q10min divide by 12
    or if q15min divide by 8 for 2 hours)

- Don’t forget to set lock-outs (maximum dose that can be given over a
    certain period of time) that includes both basal and demand doses

- Remember that the basal rate will not get to steady state for at
    least 8 hrs; When you admit pts or are transitioning pts to a PCA,
    always initiate the PCA pump with a bolus (or loading) dose

How to Order PCA at VUMC

- Select Analgesic:

<!-- -->

- \*Hydromorphone (most common): Order “Hydromorphone (DILAUDID) PCA”

- Fentanyl (if on at home; not a good inpatient PCA): Order “Fentanyl
    PCA”

- \*Morphine: Order “Morphine PCA”

<!-- -->

- Select “\[Analgesic\] PCA syringe” and adjust the following to pt
    needs:

<!-- -->

- PCA Dose (“Demand”): amount the patient gets when s/he presses the
    button

- Lockout Interval: time between which “demand” doses will not be
    administered if s/he presses the button (i.e., the PCA “locks out”)

- Continuous Dose (“Basal”): amount the pt gets per hr in continuous
    infusion

- Max Dose: maximum amount of analgesic (Basal + Demand) pt can get in
    24 hours

<!-- -->

- Select all “PCA Nursing Orders”

How to Order PCA at VA

- Under Orders, select “Pain/Sedation Infusions”

- Under “PCAs,” select Analgesic of choice (Hydromorphone or Morphine)

- Adjust the following:

<!-- -->

- Load: amount the pt will receive on initial set up of PCA

- Basal: amount the pt gets per hour in continuous infusion

- Demand: amount the pt gets when s/he presses the button

Interrogating PCA (to determine amount of analgesia pt received):

- Look at IV pump display and hit “Channel Select” on PCA

- Select “Options” in bottom left of IV pump

- Select “Patient History” on the left of the screen. This shows the
    administration history for a certain time period (e.g., 24h, 12h,
    4h, etc.)

- Hit “Zoom” on bottom of screen to change time period to 24 hours.
    Should show:

<!-- -->

- Total Drug: total amount of drug received in last 24 hours

- Total Demands: amount of times the pt has pushed the button for
    demand dose

- Delivered: amount of times the pt actually received a demand dose

- The difference between “Total Demands” and “Delivered” is the number
    of times the patient pushed the button without receiving a dose

Opioid Side effects

- Constipation: dose-dependent and will not develop tolerance. If pt
    has opioids, they need robust bowel regimen (MiraLAX, senna) with
    goal of BM ≥every 3 days

<!-- -->

- For opioid-specific constipation can do SQ Relistor<sup>TM</sup>
    (methylnaltrexone) but this is expensive and can only be given in
    the PCU or oncology floors at VUMC. For patients with chronic
    opioid-induced constipation as an outpatient can trial oral agents
    like Movantik<sup>TM</sup> (naloxgeol). Can also consider PO
    naloxone but it does have small amount of bioavailability so watch
    for systemic reversal

<!-- -->

- Nausea: occurs with opiate naïve pts. Consider starting an
    anti-emetic concurrently. Most pts will develop tachyphylaxis with
    this over a day, so the antiemetic can be discontinued

- Urinary retention: Consider role of opioids in pts with new-onset or
    worsening urinary retention. Try to de-escalate opioid dosing if
    possible

- Overdose: In pts with apneic emergency, IV 0.4 mg Naloxone; however,
    low threshold for multiple doses until response. For pts prescribed
    opioids as outpatient, need naloxone 4 mg intranasal

<!-- -->

- If a patient with chronic opiate dependence is over sedated but not
    in immediate danger of respiratory failure, one can 1) hold the dose
    of opioid and let them wake up on their own or 2) give a dose of
    naloxone 0.02-0.04mg (1/10 of the usual dose). This latter strategy
    prevents opioid withdrawal and precipitation of pain crisis in
    patients on chronic opioids

<!-- -->

- Pruritis: due to histamine release from mast cells; can be treated
    with antihistamines. The opioid can also be rotated. Some but not
    all pts will develop tachyphylaxis to this symptom

- Toxicity: hyperalgesia and neuroexcitatory effects (AMS, myoclonic
    jerking, seizures). Risk factors for neuroexcitatory effects are
    rapid titration, dehydration, and/or renal failure. Treatment is to
    rotate to a higher potency opioid and hydrate when possible

Acute and Chronic Pain – Thomas Horton, Soibhan Kelley

- There are physiological AND emotional components to pain.
    Biopsychosocial factors must be addressed. Ex: anxiety/depression,
    physical debility, and poor social support. Many pts will never be
    completely free of pain, so it is important to set realistic
    expectations

- Central sensitization is a phenomenon where the nervous system
    persists in a state of high reactivity which lowers the threshold
    for pain stimuli. Two characteristics of centralized pain are
    allodynia (pain from non-painful stimuli) and hyperalgesia (painful
    stimuli perceived as more painful)

Pharmacologic Therapy

Acetaminophen: 650mg q6hr or 1g q8h. \<3g/day. (\<2g in liver patients)

- Avoid if you are worried about masking fevers

NSAIDs: A great option for acute pain, especially musculoskeletal, HA,
and nephrolithiasis in eligible patients (ex: IV/po ketorolac,
ibuprofen, naproxen, etc.)

- Avoid in acute or chronic kidney disease and ↑ risk of bleeding.
    Caution in CAD/PVD

Topical Analgesics: Best for localized pain but utilized frequently as
part of a multimodal regimen

- Lidocaine ointment, patches (PADR needed at VA for patches. Can get
    by saying contraindication to TCA/gabapentinoids/SNRIs due to
    sedation risk)

- Menthol salicylate gel

- Diclofenac Gel

- Capsaicin gel

- Morphine gel (typically limited to oncology patients with tumor
    breakdown through skin)

Neuropathic Agents: Best for neuropathic pain but can be tried for other
chronic pain or as part of acute pain regimen. SNRIs and TCAs can
provide additional benefit if a pt has comorbid depression, anxiety, or
insomnia (TCA). Most agents take 6-8 weeks for peak effect.

- Gabapentin (Initial: 100 to 300 mg 1 to 3 times daily). Can be used
    for acute pain

- Pregabalin (Initial: 25 to 150 mg/day in 2 to 3 divided doses). Has
    better bioavailability. May work in patients who did not tolerate or
    did not have success with gabapentin

- Duloxetine (Initial: 30 mg daily for 1 to 2 weeks, then increase to
    60 mg daily as tolerated)

- Amitriptyline (Initial: 10 to 25 mg once daily at bedtime)

Muscle Relaxants: Should be used temporarily and intermittently but some
benefit from longer term use. Great for paraplegia, spinal injury,
spasticity.

- Methocarbamol (Initial: 1.5 g 3 to 4 times daily for 2 to 3 days
    then decrease dose to ≤4.5 g/day in 3 to 4 divided doses). Preferred
    initial agent as has least SE.

- Tizanidine (Initial: 2 to 4 mg every 6 to 12 hours as needed and/or
    at bedtime) – important to watch out for withdrawal in patients that
    take frequently at home.

- Cyclobenzaprine (Initial: 5 to 10 mg once daily before bedtime)

- Metaxalone (Oral: 800 mg 3 to 4 times daily)

Opioids: Frequently used in hospital for acute pain. Limit use as much
as possible in chronic pain as contributes to long-term central
sensitization. May benefit some patient populations but should always be
used as a component of a comprehensive, multimodal, patient-specific
treatment plan.

- Refer to section under Opioids: General Principles & Conversions for
    OME equivalents

<!-- -->

- If \>80 OME per day, ensure patient is prescribed naloxone

- If \>120 OME per day, refer to pain clinic

<!-- -->

- Common choices for acute pain in hospital (always start at low end
    for opioid naïve):

<!-- -->

- Oxycodone (PO) 5-10mg q4 to 6 hours prn

- Hydromorphone (IV) 0.25 to 1mg q2 to 3 hours prn

<!-- -->

- For pts on opioids at home, should always continue in hospital to
    avoid withdrawal unless clinically contraindicated. Can always
    titrate dose as needed

- Tramadol: Has opioid & NSAID properties. Of note, tramadol also
    inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Metabolized by
    CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 so there is variability between patients. Typical
    dose: 25 to 50mg q4 to 6 hours prn

NMDA Antagonists: Usually prescribed by our pain management colleagues
but worthwhile to think about as a potential option if a patient’s pain
continues to be difficult to control.

- Ketamine (IV infusion). SE includes AMS/delirium, hallucinations,
    and dissociation.

- Memantine (PO)

Alpha 2 agonists (central pain): Not commonly utilized in everyday
practice, but helpful in certain patients with chronic pain (off-label).
Guanfacine vs clonidine

Non-pharmacologic therapies

Procedural Intervention: Best utilized when there is a specific,
targetable

- Referral to chronic/interventional pain management (Nerve blocks or
    Radio-ablative therapy)

Adjunct Therapies: Patient’s will have varying opinions and responses on
adjunctive therapies, but these can be as important as any pharmacologic
therapy. CBT, personalized exercise regimen, PT/OT, chiropractor,
acupuncture

Additional Resources for Residents

- Pain Management Center at VUMC

- Pain Clinic at the VA. Would specify whether or not you are OK with
    them initiating opioids.

- Complementary and Integrative Health consult at VA

- Osher Center for Integrative Health at Vanderbilt

Acute pain for special populations

Renal dysfunction: Check that meds are renally dosed and start with
non-sedating options. Always avoid NSAIDs, morphine and codeine.

- Acetaminophen and topicals

- Opioids: oxycodone 2.5 to 5 mg, IV hydromorphone 0.25-0.5mg,
    fentanyl IV 25 to 50mcg

- Gabapentin: start with spot 100mg. Be extremely careful with quick
    up titration in CKD due to sedation risk.

- Methocarbamol: no specific renal dosing, try 500-750mg initially

Cirrhosis: Always avoid NSAIDs, morphine, codeine, hydromorphone (may be
OK in mild to moderate cirrhosis)

- Acetaminophen (2g max/d) & topicals are safe

- Gabapentin: start with spot 100mg

- Methocarbamol: no specific hepatic dosing, try 500 mg initially

- Other options: consider tramadol 25-50 mg vs oxycodone 2.5 mg

History of substance use disorder: Overnight, always review handoff as
day team likely has specific plan in place.

- With substance use history, typically rely on multimodal agents as
    above. Patients who are in recovery may prefer to avoid opioids
    themselves

- However, patients with OUD can and do have acute, severe pain due to
    injury, infections, procedures, etc. NEVER withhold opiates if
    clinically appropriate, regardless of substance use history

Hospice

Background

- Hospice: aims to provide aggressive palliative care for patients at
    the end of their life, usually when life-prolonging treatment
    options have stopped

<!-- -->

- Eligibility: less than or equal to 6- month life expectancy

    - Consider: palliative performance scale (PPS) rating of \<50-60%,
        dependence in 3 of 6 ADL’s, alteration in nutritional status, or
        documented deterioration in 4-6 months

- Levels of Care

    - General inpatient care: Patients must require skilled nursing
        care that could not be provided at home (IV medications,
        suction, high flow O2,) No cost to the patient under this level
        of care.

    - Home hospice-Patients are discharged to their "home”: which
        could be a long term care facility, assisted living facility, or
        their house.

- What is covered?

    - Personnel:

        - Hospice RN visits at least weekly and as needed; crisis
            on-call visits available 24/7

        - SW, Chaplain, Hospice MD oversight

        - CNAs: usually 1 hr, 2-3/wk at most

    - Medicines for comfort

    - Medical equipment for comfort and safety including oxygen

    - Up to 13 months of bereavement for caregivers after the death

    - Respite care for 5 days, usually in a nursing home

    - Inpatient hospice at hospice facility or at certain hospitals
        for symptom control for up to 7 days

- Hospice can be offered to patients without insurance

VA Specifics for Hospice:

- Main difference compared to VUMC is pt is allowed concurrent care

<!-- -->

- This means vets can continue to receive some treatments for the
    primary condition (e.g., palliative radiation or chemotherapy) and
    still receive hospice services

<!-- -->

- Additionally, all veterans that go on hospice should have any needed
    nursing home stay (at a contracted SNF) covered by the VA regardless
    of service connection

- VA Palliative Care team will help with these referrals

- One (1) F Status at the VA

<!-- -->

- Designates “treating specialty” as NA-HOSPICE. Reduces costs for
    families, helps quality metrics. Use this if patient qualifies and
    agrees to hospice care

- Write Delayed Transfer Orders: Admit to NA-HOSPICE and Specialty as
    “Hospice for Acute Care”

- Write a nursing text order to “Change Patient to 1-F Status”

Medications for Imminently Dying Patients

General recommendations

- At VUMC, there is a very helpful order set titled “Comfort Care
    Orders (Trauma, MICU, SICU, NEURO ICU, Palliative Care”

- Make sure to remove unnecessary medications, labs, telemetry,
    nursing text orders, etc.

Pain

- Morphine 2mg IV or SQ q1h PRN (avoid if renal failure)

- Hydromorphone 0.25 – 0.5mg IV or SQ q1h PRN

- Write as PRN, as needed for pain \> 2/10 or for air hunger

- If ineffective after 1 hours, increase by 50-100%

- If given every hour for 3-4 hours, consider an infusion (given PRN
    dose as hourly rate)

- Fentanyl is not a great option in ICU unless it is a continuous
    drip. Bolus lasts only 15 mins

Dyspnea/Tachypnea

- Assess for volume overload, considering decrease or stopping IVFs or
    tube feeds

- Opioids are the treatment of choice for dyspnea

- Consider Benzodiazepines for air hunger not controlled by opiates

- Supplemental oxygen for comfort (do not base on O2 sat). Consider
    use of cool air or fan

Restlessness/agitation/anxiety

- Assess for urinary retention, constipation, pain, other modifiable
    factors

- Lorazepam (Ativan) 0.5 – 1 mg PO or IV q4h PRN (tablet can be made
    into slurry if patient is experiencing dysphagia)

Nausea

- Ondansetron (Zofran) 4mg IV q4h or 8mg q8h PRN

- Promethazine (Phenergan) 25mg PO or PR q6h PRN; caution can be very
    sedating

- Prochlorperazine (Compazine) 10mg PO or IV q4h PRN

- Haloperidol (Haldol)

- If felt to be obstructive in etiology, try Dexamethasone 4mg IV or
    SQ q8-12h with Octreotide 100-400mcg IV or SQ q8h

- If felt to be related to anxiety, try Lorazepam; see dosing above

- Scopolamine is highly anti-cholinergic and takes time to be
    effective, so would NOT use in imminently dying patients

Secretions

- Remember: the patient is NOT bothered by their own secretions, and
    it is often the family and caregivers who are likely disturbed, so
    avoid deep suctioning

- Glycopyrrolate (Robinul) 0.2 – 0.4 mg SQ or IV q6h PRN

- Atropine 1% Ophthalmic Solution 2 drops sublingual 2-4h PRN

Video Examples for Navigating Difficult Conversations – Mohana Karlekar

Navigating difficult conversations with patients can be daunting
especially if you have never seen someone do one well before.
Conversations should follow a logical and sequential approach. much like
any procedure we perform in medicine. Like all procedures, practice

Here are some suggestions for “Navigating Difficult Conversations”

- Step 1. Determine your message-keep it simple and short

- Step 2. Identify what type of news you are communicating: breaking
    bad news, assessing understanding of information, communicating
    prognosis, or navigating goals of care

- Step 3. Pick the video that best suits your purpose

The Death Pronouncement – Michael J. Neuss

This scenario arises in a variety of contexts, including the units,
wards, and cross-cover. You might know the patient and family well, but
particularly when cross covering, that may not be the case

- This approach to the death pronouncement is based in part on the
    AAFP’s “Death Pronouncement: Survival Tips for Residents” (Am Fam
    Physician. 1998 Jul 1;58(1):284-285.)

Before Entering:

- Familiarize yourself with the most important points of the patient’s
    hospitalization and recent events. Be aware of the circumstances of
    the patient’s death, particularly whether death was expected or
    sudden.

- Inquire as to which family is present including whether the POA is
    currently at bedside

- In general, it is best to enter accompanied, ideally with the
    patient’s nurse. It is rare for the chaplain to be present but that
    might also be a consideration.

In The Room:

- Especially when cross-covering, make sure to introduce yourself to
    family, and allow them time to introduce themselves to you

- Less is more when it comes to what you say: it can be good to be
    empathetic (consider only short statements such as “I am sorry for
    your loss”) but focus mainly on the task at hand, allowing time for
    families to be present with their loved one

- Explain that you have been called to examine the patient to confirm
    that they have passed. Allow a brief time for questions; it is rare
    (but not impossible) that someone may wish to excuse themselves for
    the pronouncement

- Note the location of a working clock when you enter; your watch is
    ok too but do make sure to avoid looking at your smartphone to check
    the time of death

The Exam and Pronouncement

- Identify the patient by wrist band

- Confirm that the patient does not respond to stimuli; one discreet
    way to confirm a lack of response to tactile stimuli is to hold the
    hand, and apply pressure to a nailbed, appearing to hold the hand
    while looking at/visually inspecting the face or other part of the
    body

- Confirm the absence of spontaneous respirations and absence of heart
    sounds. Listen for a full minute as some patients have extended
    periods of apnea

- Examine the pupils and note the absence of pupillary light reflex

- Note the time at which your examination is completed. This is the
    time of death

- Make sure to ask if the family would like an autopsy to be
    performed. This is often overlooked, and as awkward as it might feel
    to ask for this, it is a requirement

- Make sure you have notified the attending of record

\*Please see further VA- and VUMC-specific guidance below

Death Process at VUMC

- The key thing is to ensure that all components are completed in the
    “Discharge as Deceased” tab under the Transfer-Discharge screen

- EACH AND EVERY component of this tab must be completed before
    Decedent Affairs will accept the body

Required steps:

- Cardiopulmonary Death Charting -\> Select “New Reading” and
    complete.

- Cardiopulmonary Death -\>Select “+Create Note”

- Medical Examiner Criteria -\> Select “+New Reading”; Criteria
    requiring notification of ME is listed in a drop down menu in the
    navigator. Includes accidental deaths, threats to public health,
    suspicion for foul play, etc. The Vanderbilt Operator can assist
    with connecting you to the ME; alternatively, you can call
    615-743-1800 during business hours (M-F 8am – 4:30pm) or the
    after-hours pager at 800-216-0107.

<!-- -->

- All patients diagnosed with Covid are automatic ME cases

<!-- -->

- Autopsy Criteria -\> Select “+New Reading”

- Preliminary Cause of Death and Date/Time of Death -\>. Rather than
    list “Cardiopulmonary arrest,” be specific (e.g., Pulmonary
    Embolism, Myocardial Infarction, Metastatic Colon Cancer, etc.)

- Deceased’s Info – Report of Death

<!-- -->

- If you need to leave this and return later after collecting
    information, you can access your partially complete entries by
    clicking on the date/time text that appears under the ribbon. This
    is not intuitive because the numbers listing the date/time do not at
    all appear as though they act like a hyperlink (but they do).

- Be specific; TDS will want you to have listed the name of the family
    you notified, the TDS Case Number (which the RN typically enters),
    and your attending physician’s name (to sign the death certificate;
    give their pager number in this subsection).

<!-- -->

- Report of Death Note -\> Select “+New Reading” and complete.

- Complete Synopsis + Hospital Course and then at the very bottom
    under Summary of Death select “+Create Note.”

- Once all of this paperwork is finished, be sure to touch base with
    the patient’s nurse, usually contact Decedent Affairs and assist in
    making sure the body is moved

Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation

Editors: Doug Bryant, MD, Jake Dovgan, MD, Nick Abramson, MD, and
William Galbraith, DO

Reviewed by C.J. Plummer, MD

Rehabilitation Options – Evan Berlin, Scott Miller, Adam Epps, Lauren
Massey

**Physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R)** physicians focus on
restoring function and quality of life to those with physical
impairments or disabilities affecting the brain, spinal cord, nerves,
bones, joints, ligaments, muscles, and tendons

**Physiatrists** specialize in determining appropriate rehab options for
hospitalized patients

Acute Inpatient Rehabilitation (IPR) or Inpatient Rehabilitation
facility (IRF):

- IPR involves a multidisciplinary team of physicians, physical
    therapists, occupational therapists, speech and language
    pathologists

- Pts admitted to IPR must be able to tolerate a minimum of 3 hours of
    rehab per day for 5 days a week

- Pts must have medical complexity warranting medical supervision by a
    physician

- Physicians are required to evaluate admitted patients at least 3
    times a week

- Average length of stay (LOS) in acute inpatient rehab is 10-12 days

Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF):

- Patients admitted to SNF require skilled needs: Wound care, IV
    therapy, Catheter care, PT, OT, and/or SLP

- There are no minimal requirements for daily therapy, but patients
    may receive up to 1.5 hours/day, depending on availability at the
    facility (in practice it is often less than this)

- Physicians are required to evaluate admitted patients at least once
    every 30 days

- Average length of stay is 26 days

Long-Term Acute Care Hospital (LTACH):

- Pts admitted to LTACH require extended hospitalization and include
    pts who will be receiving prolonged mechanical ventilation

- Pts will be recommended for transfer to an LTACH when no reasonable
    functional or medical improvement can be expected in an acute
    inpatient stay

- LTACHs can be within a hospital or may be free-standing

- Average length of stay must be greater than 25 days

Assisted Living:

- Pts receive a combination of long-term housing, personal care
    services, and health care

- Designed for individuals who need assistance with activities of
    daily living

- Can be provided in freestanding communities, near or integrated with
    SNFs, hospitals or retirement communities

Outpatient Services:

- Can be ordered at discharge with or without official PT/OT
    recommendations

- Home health (HH): wide range of healthcare services provided in
    patients home ranging from wound care to IV antibiotics

<!-- -->

- HH PT/OT: pts can receive therapy at home when unable to attend
    outpatient PT/OT

- HH nursing services: required for IV antibiotics or PICC line
    maintenance; consider for wound care, other services include
    medication adherence and reconciliation

- HH non-skilled aide: outside the scope of acute hospitalization, but
    helps with ADLs

<!-- -->

- Outpatient PT/OT: Consider for those who would benefit from therapy
    but do not meet the qualifications for other dispositions or would
    prefer outpatient therapy

PM&R Consultation – Evan Berlin, Scott Miller, Adam Epps, Lauren Massey

Reasons for Consultation/Referral to PM&R:

- If PT/OT recommends Inpatient Rehabilitation (IPR) for post-acute
    disposition

<!-- -->

- Recommended for pts with: Spinal Cord Injuries, Traumatic Brain
    Injuries, Poly-trauma, CVA, Amputation, Burns, Critical Illness
    /Acute Polyneuropathies or Myopathies, Prolonged Hospitalization

<!-- -->

- Benefits of PM&R Consults include:

<!-- -->

Spasticity – Doug Bryant and Jake Dovgan

Background

- Spasticity is a velocity-dependent increase in resistance to passive
    stretch.

- It differs from hypertonia in that hypertonia is resistance to
    passive stretch that is not velocity-dependent.

- Spasticity is believed to result from disruption of descending
    inhibitory modulation of the alpha motor neurons by an upper motor
    lesion, producing hyperexcitability.

- Grading (by the Modified Ashworth Scale)

<!-- -->

- 0=no increase in tone

- 1=slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch and release
    or by minimal resistance at the end of ROM when affected part is
    moved in flexion or extension

- 1+=slight increase in muscle tone, manifested by a catch followed by
    minimal resistance through the remainder of ROM (less than half)

- 2=more marked increase in muscle tone through most of ROM, but
    affected part is easily moved.

- 3=considerable increases in muscle tone; passive movement difficult

- 4=affected part is rigid in flexion or extension

Management

- Spasticity can have functional benefits, including improving
    standing and transfers. However, it can also cause weakness, poor
    dexterity, pain, and contractures.

- If spasticity is having undesirable effects, first line of treatment
    is PT/OT and physical modalities such as stretching.

- Oral Medications

| Medication                | Mechanism of Action                             | Side Effects/Important Considerations                                            |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Baclofen                  | GABA-B agonist                                  | sedation, fatigue, nausea, centrally acting – risk of withdrawal                 |
| Tizanidine                | Alpha-2 agonist                                 | sedation, dizziness, xerostomia, weakness, centrally acting – risk of withdrawal |
| Diazepam/ Benzodiazepines | GABA-A agonist                                  | sedation, confusion, hypotension, centrally acting – risk of withdrawal          |
| Dantrolene                | inhibits Ca release from sarcoplasmic reticulum | weakness, sedation, nausea, hepatotoxicity, acts directly on skeletal muscle     |

- Intrathecal baclofen: Reserved for patients who have significant
    side effects with oral anti-spasticity medications or who have
    severe, persistent, and diffuse spasticity despite maximal doses.

- Injections

<!-- -->

- Botulinum toxin: Blocks the presynaptic release of acetylcholine
    from motor endplates of the lower motor neuron at the myoneural
    junction. Effect usually lasts 3-8months

- Alcohol block: Phenol and ethanol are neurolytic agents that can be
    used to block nerves with motor function.

<!-- -->

- Surgeries

<!-- -->

- Selective dorsal rhizotomy, osteotomy, muscle tendon lengthening,
    release, or transfer

\*\*\*If a patient experiences worsening of spasticity, it is important
to consider other underlying conditions such as infections, pressure
ulcers, constipation, or bladder distention\*\*\*

Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) – Jake Dovgan and Doug Bryant

Background

- TBI is categorized as a disruption in brain function leading to
    decreased consciousness, memory deficits, neurological deficits, or
    intracranial lesion.

- This disruption is a result of an external blow or force.

- Most common causes of TBI are falls and MVC.

- Falls are the most common cause of TBI in elderly population.

Assessment

- Mechanism of injury

- Initial GCS

- Loss of consciousness and duration

- Other injuries

- Initial evaluation should include a non-contrasted head CT to rule
    out hemorrhage

- Full neuro exam including but not limited to cranial nerves,
    strength, cognition (orientation), memory, reflexes, sensation,
    cerebellar testing, range of motion of joints, Babinski, and
    Hoffmann's

Classification

| Severity | GCS   | Post-Traumatic Amnesia | Loss of Consciousness       |
|----------|-------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Mild     | 13-15 | \<1 day                | \<30 minutes                |
| Moderate | 9-12  | 1 day to 7 days        | \>30 minutes and \<24 hours |
| Severe   | 3-8   | \>1 week               | \> 24 hours                 |

Evaluation and Management

- Secondary complications following TBI:

<!-- -->

- In the acute setting, patients who have had a TBI are at risk for
    seizures, agitation, autonomic problems, bowel/bladder, wounds,
    vertigo, headaches, and cognitive impairment, venous thrombosis, and
    spasticity

<!-- -->

- If concerned about TBI would consult PM&R and Speech Therapy for
    assistance in management of complications and assessment of
    cognition.

- If concerned for spasticity refer to “Spasticity section” for
    specific medication recommendations.

Musculoskeletal (MSK) Injuries

Shoulder Pain – Joseph Nowatzke

Background

- Bones: Clavicle, Scapula (Acromion and Coracoid process) and
    Proximal Humerus  

- Rotator Cuff: Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres minor,
    subscapularis

- Neurovascular: anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries,
    branching off axillary artery; Innervated by axillary,
    suprascapular, subscapular nerve off brachial plexus  

- Labrum is a cup-shaped rim of cartilage lining and reinforces the
    shoulder joint by surrounding the glenoid fossa, allowing extra
    support to the head of the humerus

Presentation

- Brachial Plexus Palsies 

- Vascular Pathology (e.g. thoracic outlet syndrome, thrombus,
    atherosclerosis, vasculitis) 

<!-- -->

- Typical symptoms are tightness, heaviness, cramping, or weakness
    in arm 

<!-- -->

- Rotator Cuff Injuries:  

<!-- -->

- Impingement Syndrome: supraspinatus is most susceptible

- Tendinopathy: develops after repetitive motions; pain worsens with
    active movement

- Tendon Tear: develop as a progression of tendinopathy; develops
    weakness

<!-- -->

- Labral Tear & SLAP (superior labral tear from anterior to
    posterior): develop in repetitive overhead motions (swimming,
    baseball, tennis); often described as a “catching” sensation 

- Adhesive capsulitis: “frozen shoulder” stiffened glenohumeral joint,
    loss of both active and passive RoM. Increased frequency in
    diabetics 

- AC (acromioclavicular) joint pain: joint often affected by OA, RA
    and common cause for anterior shoulder pain shoulder separations
    and osteoarthritis  

- Glenohumeral OA: degeneration of articular cartilage and subchondral
    bone with narrowing of the glenohumeral joint. Presents in older
    adults with progressively worsening anterior shoulder pain and
    stiffness in both passive and active ROM

- Biceps Tendinopathy: localized anterior shoulder pain, worsened with
    overhead lifting; when rupture develops, will often have a “lump”
    and acute worsening of symptoms 

- Posterior shoulder pain often related to cervical radiculopathy 

Evaluation

- Physical Exam: 

<!-- -->

- Inspection: Symmetry, erythema, ecchymosis, swelling, deformity,
    muscle atrophy (deltoid, infraspinatus), scapular winging 

- Palpation: warmth, landmarks, tenderness: SC joint, clavicle, AC
    joint, acromion, spine of scapula, bicipital groove, biceps tendon,
    greater tuberosity of humerus, common myofascial trigger points
    (trapezius, levator scapulae, rhomboids, supraspinatus) 

- Passive ROM: performed by the examiner without patient assistance

    - Helps to distinguish motion limitations caused by a structural
        constraint (adhesive capsulitis) vs. motion limitations caused
        by pain 

- Active ROM: performed by the pt on their own. Loss of active motion
    usually indicates weakness due to either muscular (tears) or nerve
    injury 

- C-spine: evaluate the C-spine as the origin of pain that may be
    referred to the shoulder 

- Provocation tests: see Below

<!-- -->

- Imaging:  

<!-- -->

- Not as useful as a thorough physical exam, especially if
    non-traumatic pain 

- XR: AP (Internal Rotation, External Rotation), Lateral, Scapular and
    axillary views 

- CT: often reserved for traumatic fracture and artificial joint
    assessment 

- MRI w/out contrast: used to evaluate soft tissues, tendons, muscle
    and bursae

- Ultrasound: becoming more useful for initial evaluation of rotator
    cuff

Management

- Fractures: require assessment by orthopedics for reduction and
    surgical intervention

- Soft Tissue Injuries, Arthritis 

<!-- -->

- Conservative management: referral to PT for muscle strengthening,
    flexibility, and postural improvement.  

- Consider short course of NSAIDs, 7-10 days (meloxicam, diclofenac)
    for pain relief

Neck Pain – Samir Khan

Background

- Most common cause of neck pain in adults: degenerative changes of
    the cervical spine

- Most atraumatic neck pain does not require imaging

Presentation

- Cervical muscle strain:  pain + stiffness with movement 2/2 muscular
    injury

- Degenerative disc disease/osteoarthritis: pain + stiffness with
    movement from derangement in disc architecture leads to inability to
    distribute pressure in the joint

- Cervical radiculopathy: neuropathic pain, sensory abnormalities,
    and/or weakness in an upper extremity (often radiating to hand)

- Cervical myelopathy: spinal cord compression causing neurologic
    dysfunction

<!-- -->

- Earliest symptom is gait disturbance. Pain is uncommon

<!-- -->

- Non-cervical conditions: shoulder pathology, migraine/headaches,
    occipital neuralgia, torticollis, thoracic outlet syndrome, angina
    pectoris/MI, bony metastases, vertebral artery or carotid artery
    dissection, fibromyalgia, meningitis, transverse myelitis 

- Posterior neck pain 

<!-- -->

- Axial only à MSK (sprain vs degenerative disc disease) 

- Axial + Extremity Pain  Radiculopathy 

<!-- -->

- Anterior neck pain 

<!-- -->

- Common sources: esophageal, thyroiditis, carotidynia, lymphadenitis,
    Ludwig’s angina

- Red flags: recent trauma, lower extremity weakness, gait
    abnormality, bowel/bladder incontinence, fever, weight loss 

Evaluation

- Determine MSK (axial pain) vs Radiculopathy/Myelopathy vs
    Non-spinal

Acute Back Pain – Christian Roehmer

Background

- \>90% of back pain is nonspecific and musculoskeletal in nature

- Can’t Miss: Spinal cord compression, cauda equina, cancer, spinal
    abscess, discitis, or osteomyelitis

- Extra-axial causes: Pancreatitis, nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis,
    AAA, zoster

Presentation

- Lumbar strain: diffuse pain in lumbar muscles, may radiate 

- Degenerative disk or facet process: localized lumbar pain, similar
    to lumbar strain 

- Inflammatory arthritis: morning stiffness, improves with movement,
    systemic symptoms 

- Osteoarthritis: pain with use, improves with rest 

- Herniated disk: radiating pain to legs, often below the knees 

- Compression fracture: older patients, trauma, spine tenderness on
    exam

<!-- -->

- Inspection: Should include posture, Adam’s Forward Bend Test
    (screens for scoliosis), and limb length discrepancy à kyphosis,
    lordosis, or scoliosis 

- Palpation/Percussion: Sensitive for identifying spinal infection,
    metastases, or compression fractures

    - Spinous processes, lumbar “step-offs,” paravertebral muscles and
        SI joint

- Range of Motion: Pain with extension and relieved by flexion
    suggests spinal stenosis  

- Neurologic Examination:

    - L2: hip flexion; L3: knee extension; L4: dorsiflexion; L5: great
        toe flexion 

    - S1: plantarflexion 

- Waddell’s Signs:  Raise suspicion of non-organic pain  

    - Superficial tenderness, pain that improves with
        distraction (attention diverted)

    - Pain with sham maneuvers (simulation)

    - Overreaction (disproportionate psychomotor responses)

    - Non-physiologic neurologic deficits

Anticoagulation and Bleeding Risk

| Anticoagulant         | How Long to Hold          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| Heparin gtt           | 4-8 hours, ensure PTT wnl |
| LMWH                  | 12-24 hours               |
| Dabigatran (Pradaxa)  | 1-2 days                  |
| Apixaban (Eliquis)    | 1-2 day                   |
| Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) | 1-2 days                  |
| Warfarin (Coumadin)   | 5-7 days                  |

Platelets, INR: refer to individual procedure sections for
procedure-specific guidelines

Anesthesia and Sedation

- May be used when pain or anxiety may impede performance and success

- Relative Contraindications: old age, dementia, respiratory
    difficulty

- Aim to use local anesthesia with l% to minimize procedural sedation

- Creating wheal: clean surface w/ chlorhexidine or alcohol swab; with
    22-25G needle, advance needle nearly parallel to skin and aspirate
    to ensure no blood vessel involved, then inject anesthetic to create
    1-2 cm of raised skin; If deeper subcutaneous anesthesia is needed,
    advance needle perpendicular to skin, aspirate as advancing then
    inject the tract, inject anesthetic as needle is withdrawn

- Local anesthesia can alter landmarks, always double check anatomy
    after injection

- Minimal Sedation: 0.25mg-2mg Ativan IV or 1mg-2.5mg Midazolam IV

<!-- -->

- Midazolam (Versed): faster on (2-5 min) and faster off (30-60 min)

- Lorazepam (Ativan): onset 5-10 min; Duration 4-8 hours

Paracentesis

Video Guide

- VUMC Procedure Service video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQSsb9705LE&t=160s>
- NEJM video: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVpwXK7cvzQ>

Indications

- Diagnostic: Evaluation of new onset ascites or of known ascites with
    concern for SBP

- Therapeutic: tense ascites, refractory to diuretics, causing pt
    discomfort

Relative Contraindications

- Significant bowel distension due to ileus or SBO, hemodynamic
    instability (due to large fluid shifts with LVP), DIC,
    infection/breakdown of skin overlying puncture site

Consent

- Risks: abdominal wall hematoma (1%), hemoperitoneum, organ puncture
    / bowel perforation, infection, ascitic fluid leak

Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 20k, INR \< 4 \* (note that
    cirrhosis complicates INR interpretation)

- If therapeutic, determine volume pt typically gets drained so you
    have enough bottles (tip: call service center to request bottles be
    sent to RN station if you can't find enough)

- Labs (order before so nurse can print off labels): cell count
    w/diff, BF culture, BF & serum albumin, total protein; cytology if
    c/f malignancy; BF/serum Hct if bloody

- Measure skin/subQ depth with US to help choose sufficiently long
    needle for diagnostic paras

Procedural considerations

- Ultrasound Probe: curvilinear

- Identify safe pocket (\>2 cm deep), with no nearby bowel or
    adhesions

- Local anesthesia with lidocaine all the way to peritoneum, as this
    is most sensitive part

- Kit: 6 Fr Safe-T-Centesis Kit; gather cx bottles, cx bottle syringe
    adaptor, specimen cup

- If only diagnostic, use 18G needle with 20-50cc syringe rather than
    kit

- If high bleeding risk, use long 18G needle & attach to syringe
    instead of 6 Fr. Catheter

- Avoid surgical scars out of concern for nearby adhesions and
    superficial veins

- Attempt as lateral as possible to avoid inferior epigastric vessels

- Roll patient to left or right side to promote pooling of fluid for
    easier/safer access

- Inoculate culture bottles at bedside rather than sending fluid
    samples to lab for inoculation to increase yield 50% 80% (Note that
    VA does not allow bedside inoculation.)

- If hernia present, have patient reduce it while draining fluid to
    prevent incarceration

Post-procedural considerations

- Albumin (25%) for large volume (\>5L fluid removal): give 8 g per
    liter removed, up to 50 g

- Ascitic leak: Can try skin glue or place 1 figure-of-eight stitch
    with 4.0 vicryl

- Bleeding complication: hold pressure with quick-clot and gauze for
    \>5-10 mins if persistent bleeding at site; if profuse bleeding or
    concern for organ injury, STAT page EGS and/or IR

Thoracentesis

NEJM Video Guide: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivTyH09BcHg>

Indications

- New pleural effusion that has no obvious explanation (not attributed
    to HF alone) or concern for pleural space infection

- Any respiratory symptoms that would positively respond to large
    volume thoracentesis (\>1L)

Contraindications

- Skin infection at needle insertion site

- Large-volume thoracentesis in hepatic hydrothorax (tends to
    reaccumulate). Suspected unexpandable lung

Consent

- Common risks (\> 5%): coughing, fainting, PTX

- Rare risks (\< 1%): hemothorax, re-expansion pulmonary edema,
    liver/spleen puncture

Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 50k, INR \< 2 \* (risk/benefit
    evaluation outside these)

- If loculations present on US, high risk, or any question about
    indication, refer to Pulm

- Labs (order before so nurse can print labels): cell count w/diff; BF
    culture, BF & serum LDH, BF & serum total protein; BF & serum Hct if
    bloody; cytology if c/f malignancy; consider triglycerides if
    concerned for chylothorax

Procedural considerations

- US Probe: Cardiac (or Linear) to identify safe pocket (\>2 cm)
    between lung and diaphragm (ask Interventional Pulm or IR if sample
    is needed of a smaller pocket)

- Kit: 6Fr Safe-T-Centesis kit

- Upright position is typically preferred; lateral to mid-scap/mid-ax.
    If patient unable to sit upright, refer to procedure team vs
    pulmonology

- Effusion size: if unable to tap above 9th rib, too small; CXR with
    costophrenic angle blunting should correlate to \~250-500mL

- Insert needle superior to rib to avoid neurovascular bundle (bundles
    run below)

- Stop if pt has any new/increased chest discomfort, aggressive
    unremitting cough, frank purulence or air on aspiration,
    lightheadedness, hypotension, or vagal response

- Stop fluid removal after 1.5 L of chronic pleural effusion to reduce
    re-expansion pulmonary edema

Post-procedural considerations

- If needing cytology, send at least 60 – 100cc

- Bleeding complication: STAT page Thoracic Surgery

- PTX: if pt stable & asymptomatic, supplemental O2 and repeat CXR in
    4hrs; if unstable/symptomatic STAT page to Thoracic Surgery

- Re-expansion pulmonary edema: persistent cough, frothy sputum.
    Diffuse GGO on side of thoracentesis. Supportive management (oxygen,
    monitor); most resolve in 24-48 hrs. If respiratory distress
    progresses, may need mechanical ventilation

- Documentation: Effusion US characteristics (anechoic, layering
    debris, septations), reason for ending procedure (stopped early due
    to chest discomfort, complication vs tapped dry), presence of lung
    sliding, if more than scant residual effusion remains post-procedure

- A routine chest radiograph after thoracentesis is no longer
    indicated for most asymptomatic, non-ventilated patients. Check lung
    slide with US in 2D and M-mode

Central Line

NEJM video guide: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeVdRCqy_mo>

Indications

- Extracorporeal therapies: HD, CRRT, Plasma (PLEX) or RBC exchange
    transfusion

- Venous access for: vasopressors, chemotherapy, parenteral nutrition,
    hemodynamic monitoring (CVP, ScvO2) and cardiac parameters (via PA
    catheter), inadequate peripheral access

Relative Contraindications

- Increased bleeding risk, anatomic distortion at site selection,
    indwelling vascular hardware (pacemaker, HD access), vascular injury
    proximal to site, skin infection overlying selected site

Consent

- Immediate complications: bleeding, malposition, arterial puncture,
    arrhythmia, pneumo- or hemothorax, air embolism, damage to
    surrounding structures (nerves, thoracic duct)

- Delayed complications: infection, thromboembolism, myocardial
    perforation, venous stenosis

Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 20k, INR \< 3

- All patients need to have telemetry & pulse oximetry monitoring

- With every pt, consider LENGTH, LOCATION, LUMENS, and LINE TYPE!

|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Internal Jugular Vein | Minimal risk of PTX; improve target with positioning and use of US; easily compressible if bleeding occurs | Risk of carotid puncture, difficult in obese pt; vein collapsibility with hypovolemia       |
| Subclavian            | More comfortable for pts; landmark driven approach; lowest risk infection                                  | Increased risk of PTX, harder to control bleeding with pressure, technically more difficult |

Procedural considerations

- Numb pt right after draping, then set up everything to allow time
    for lidocaine to work

- Set supplies up in exactly the order of use to ensure all are
    present and functioning

- Cap side ports with blue claves (not included in Trialysis kit)
    prior to flushing

- For IJ access, place pt in slight Trendelenburg position to engorge
    vein

- While advancing needle, ensure constant negative pressure with
    aspiration of plunger and visualization of needle tip with US

- Designate someone to watch tele while threading guidewire to monitor
    for arrhythmias; limit guidewire insertion depth to no more than 16
    cm to reduce arrhythmia risk

- Always ensure guidewire is secured while it is inside a vein

- Always ensure target for venous cannulation is visualized and
    guidewire is placed correctly prior to dilation: 1) Compression of
    target vessel 2) Non-pulsatile dark blood return (unless on
    100%FiO2, may be brighter red) 3) US visualization or needle and
    wire 4) can use pressure tubing and angiocath to confirm CVP or
    obtain venous O2 sat

Post-procedural considerations

- Every IJ or subclavian central line needs a confirmation CXR to
    confirm no PTX

- Ideal placement of distal tip: in SVC just outside the right atrium,
    approximately near/superior to carina and right tracheobronchial
    angle

- Troubleshooting Complications:

<!-- -->

- Arterial Access or puncture: immediately remove needle and hold
    pressure for 15 mins to prevent hematoma formation; if uncontrolled
    bleeding or artery was dilated, STAT vascular surgery consult

- Bleeding: place direct pressure; subclavian access precludes ability
    to compress and confers highest bleeding risk; if uncontrolled, STAT
    vascular surgery consult

- Pulmonary Complications: if free air aspirated into syringe,
    consider PTX vs poor seal of syringe & needle. Close attention to
    pulmonary complication & STAT CXR to assess PTX. If rapid
    deterioration, needle decompression and chest tube placement
    required

- Venous Air Embolism: can occur if air introduced to system during
    placement, flushing, or if left open to the atmosphere. Effects are
    variable, but if suspected, place pt in left lateral decubitus
    position to trap air in right apex and place pt on 100% O2 to speed
    resorption

- Arrhythmia: rationale for telemetry monitoring as guidewire can lead
    to atrial or ventricular arrhythmias; immediately withdraw wire to
    lesser depth; if arrythmia persists, abort procedure and treat
    patient and determine cause

Lumbar Puncture

NEJM video Guide: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnH9gECy_wU>

Indications

- Diagnosis of suspected CNS infections, CNS malignancies,
    demyelinating diseases, IIH, NPH, autoimmune encephalitis, suspected
    SAH with negative imaging

Absolute Contraindications

- Increased intracranial pressure with risk of herniation (i.e.
    space-occupying lesions, cerebral edema, obstructive hydrocephalus),
    infection or epidural abscess over puncture site, trauma to lumbar
    vertebrae

Relative Contraindications

- ↑ intracranial pressure, thrombocytopenia, bleeding diatheses

Consent

- Common risks: back pain (\~66%), severe headache

- Rare risks: spinal hematoma (\<0.001%), weakness, radicular
    pain/numbness, bleeding, brain function problems, CNS infection,
    brain herniation

Pre-procedural considerations:

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 50k, INR \< 1.6 (stricter
    guidelines d/t spinal hematoma risk)

- CT head not generally needed prior to LP to rule out mass lesion;
    consider if presence of focal neurologic signs, papilledema, recent
    seizure, or immunocompromise

- Consider sending to fluoro-guided if: attempts without imaging are
    unsuccessful, obese pts with no palpable anatomy, severe scoliosis,
    prior spine surgery, borderline low plts and multiple sticks might
    be needed, or pt requires heavy sedation

- Anticoagulation: full dose LMWH must be off 24h, ppx LMWH off 12h,
    ppx heparin off 8h, hep gtt off 4-8hrs with repeat lab demonstrating
    normalized PT, P2Y12 inhibitors should be off 7 days to avoid
    bleeding risks, IR guidelines require Plavix to be off 5 days (ASA
    alone is OK)

- Labs: cell count w/diff, BF culture, glucose, protein; freeze sample
    for future/additional labs (order in epic); if infectious or
    neurological labs are needed, consider consult first

- Ensure lateral decubitus position for opening pressure with glass
    pressure manometer

Procedural considerations

- US Probe: Linear (can use curvilinear in obese pts) in transverse
    axis to establish midline & in sagittal axis to identify spinous
    processes

- Anesthetic use: Lidocaine 1-2% (likely need more than what is
    provided in kit; consider empiric anesthetization of 2 spaces +/-
    Pain-Ease spray

- Increased number of attempts = increased success rates

- Higher rate of success if stylet is removed before entering
    subarachnoid space to better observe flow of CSF once in the
    subarachnoid space. Stylet should be replaced prior to LP needle
    removal

- Aspiration of CSF = increased risk of bleeding. Don’t aspirate!

- Volume removal for studies: Basic only 2mL per tube in 1-4. Many
    studies ordered: 3mL per tube (\*consider calling lab to confirm).
    Cytology desired: call lab to confirm amount needed (rule of thumb
    2/2/6/2mL); Tube 4 is sent for micro to reduce contamination.
    Therapeutic high volume: 30mL max

Post-procedural considerations

- Post-LP headache (\~10%): encourage pt to lay flat to reduce the
    intensity of symptoms (but does not prevent it); if prolonged,
    consider blood patch (c/s Anesthesia)

- Neuro changes OR bleeding complications: STAT non-contrast MRI
    lumbar spine for epidural hematoma, q1 neuro-checks x4hrs then q2
    for 24-48hrs & consult NSGY

- Sample cannot be tubed; someone must walk fluid to the lab

- Resuming anticoagulation: 1h UFH, 4h LMWH, 6-8h
    rivaroxaban/apixaban, 6h dabigatran/fondaparinux. Longer periods
    should be considered after traumatic tap, and post-procedure
    monitoring of neurological function is recommended for all pts

Arterial Line

NEJM video Guide: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8hK04ai17-k&list=PLaxEyg3FbHI8x5IQMWD0qtbXEzN5RdIKM&index=3>

Indications

- Continuous, accurate hemodynamic monitoring (pts requiring
    vasopressor titration, pts whose BP accuracy is in question)

- Need for frequent ABGs

Contraindications

- Abnormal Allen's test, thrombosis of selected site, distorted
    anatomy at selected site (known prior fistulas, grafts,
    malformations), severe PAD at selected site, Raynaud's of selected
    limb

Consent

- Bruising, pain, damage to adjacent structures, infection, bleeding
    (possible extension to RP bleed with femoral placement), hematoma
    formation, vascular complications (dissection, AV fistula,
    pseudoaneurysm), thrombosis, rarely distal ischemia

Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** no definitive guidelines (some suggest
    plts \> 50K, INR \< 3, PTT \< 100)

- Palpate of artery of interest to best understand anatomy and
    surrounding structures

- Allen Test if placing radial artery access: goal to assess
    collateral ulnar blood flow to avoid ischemia. Compress both radial
    and ulnar artery 10-15 sec to allow blanching of palm, then release
    ulnar artery to assess re-perfusion. If blanching quickly resolves,
    ulnar artery will allow distal perfusion

- If attempting radial access, ensure wrist is adequately extended;
    use towel roll under wrist and tape hand to bed or table

- Discuss with fellow prior to brachial a-line placement

- Ask RN to prepare tubing and waveform monitoring prior to time-out

Procedural considerations

- Types of Kits

<!-- -->

- Arrow kit: all-in-one device that has arterial catheter over
    introducer needle

- A-line kit: individual introducer needle, guidewires, and sutures;
    multiple steps

- Micropuncture kit: atraumatic guidewire, microcatheter and
    introducer sheath

<!-- -->

- Reconfirm location with US after lidocaine

- Ensure arterial access (pulsatile flow of bright red blood)

Post- procedural considerations

- Immediately connect pressure tubing to catheter while maintaining
    sterile technique

- Observe monitor for arterial waveform to verify appropriate
    placement

- If persistent bleeding, hold pressure for 15 mins

US-Guided PIV

VUMC video Guide: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQGhciB6TvM>

Indications

- Vascular access; large bore (16-18G) is optimal for blood
    transfusion and faster than central lines (except MAC/Cordis);
    preserves central access (important for ESRD patients)

Relative Contraindications

- Infection over the site, severe bleeding diathesis

- Avoid EJs unless have been trained due to airway compromise if
    extravasation occurs

Consent

- Common risks: arterial puncture, nerve irritation/damage, infection,
    infiltration, thrombus formation

Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 10k, no specific INR
    guidelines

- Location selection: anuric AKI or ESRD patients – d/w renal, avoid
    limb with HD access proximal

- Target selection: Confirm venous choice with compressibility and
    lack of doppler flow. Should follow the rule of 2s: vein must be at
    least twice the diameter of the catheter being placed, should be no
    more than 2 inches in depth from the surface of the skin, and should
    have at least 2 inches of straight (non-tortuous) length

Procedural considerations

- US Probe: Linear

- Kit: IV start kit; ideally 18G needle

- Anesthetic use: Consider EMLA

- 1st choice: basilic, cephalic veins; 2nd choice: brachial vein
    (caution adjacent artery)

- Use tourniquet

- Start at 45° angle, use 45-45-90 rule to determine starting location
    (start as far from center of probe as the vessel is deep), flatten
    angle once in the vessel to advance ("walk" your way through the
    vessel by repeatedly identifying needle tip in the lumen and
    advancing)

- Going too shallow could use up too much catheter leaving nothing to
    put in the vein.

- Going too steep can cause catheter kinking at the hub where it
    sticks out of the skin

- Hold probe close to skin, holding probe far from the end allows too
    much movement

- Center the vessel on the ultrasound probe screen prior to sticking,
    place midline on US screen

- Use both short axis and long axis views to ensure correct placement

- Short axis- Vessel looks round like a target, helps to scout out the
    tip, and is best for ensuring the vein is entered as opposed to a
    neighboring artery

- Long axis- The length of the vessel is viewed. This view is intended
    for the final few millimeters of catheter advancement into the vein
    to ensure both bevel and plastic sheath lumen traverse the
    endothelial layer before threading catheter

Post-procedural considerations

- DON’T FORGET TO REMOVE TOURNIQUET!! Remove before flushing to
    prevent blowing vein

- Bleeding complication: if arterial, remove catheter & hold pressure
    at least 5 mins

Dobhoff Tube

Indications

- Enteral feeding and medication administration if unable to swallow

- DHT v NGT: DHT deliver meds and fluids, NGT provide suction to
    decompress (can also deliver meds/fluids); nurses place NGT,
    residents (and ICU nurses) place DHT qUh5AJ5uIZo

Relative Contraindications

- Esophageal varices or strictures (most hepatologists say this is not
    a contra-indication, but discuss if recent bleed or recent banding)

- Other altered gastric anatomy that may prevent passage. (i.e.
    gastric bypass, esophageal hernias, tumors or other possible
    obstructions)

- SBO or ileus (use NGT instead for suction)

Absolute Contraindications for blind approach

- Facial trauma, basilar skull fracture, pharyngeal or esophageal
    trauma

Consent

- Common risks: malposition (lung -\> pneumothorax or pneumonia;
    pyriform sinus; coiling anywhere along tract); perforation anywhere
    along the tract; aspiration, nasal ulceration, esophagitis,
    gastritis, bleeding, vagal response, discomfort

Pre-procedural considerations

- **Bleeding risk guidelines:** Plts \> 10k, no specific INR
    guidelines

- Make sure DHT and bridle sizes correlate

- Measure expected advancement depth by measuring distance from tip of
    nose, around ear, and to xiphoid process

- Prior to placement, fasten the stylet in the fully-hubbed position
    to reduce bending and folding over of the weighted tip while
    advancing

- Apply anesthetic with lidocaine gel (order Lidocaine uro-jet) and
    nasal swab to reduce pt discomfort, reduce gag reflex, and assist
    with clearance of the nasal passages

- Consider fluoro-guided placement after 3 failed bedside attempts

- Post-pyloric placement

<!-- -->

- Consider in patients with high pulmonary aspiration risk, severe
    esophageal reflux/esophagitis, recurrent emesis, impaired gastric
    mobility, and pancreatitis

- Refer for fluoro-guided post-pyloric advancement after 1 failed
    bedside attempt

Procedural Considerations

- Have the patient sit upright with their head tilted toward the chest
    to encourage posterior oropharyngeal positioning of the DHT while
    advancing

- Tip: advance horizontally (nose tip to ear lobe), not angled up

- If pt can participate safely, have the patient swallow in
    conjunction with advancement; pt can suck on straw (with small sips
    of water if low aspiration risk) to utilize pharyngeal muscles to
    position DHT into esophagus

- Place bridle and dog-bone tape while at the bedside to reduce
    dislodgement

- Excessive coughing, difficulty phonating, or resistance may indicate
    tracheal placement; withdraw tube and re-attempt. Consider Duonebs
    to reduce bronchospasms

- Post-pyloric placement has been shown to be up to 90% successful
    with intermittent insufflation of 10-20cc of air \~every 10cm of
    advancement after 55cm to promote pylorus opening. IV Reglan or
    erythromycin may also help

- When placing bridle (recommend AFTER xray confirmation), keep
    alignment markers (marked on both probes) together so magnetic tips
    will align once past the nasal septum

- When placing the bridle, remove the green stylet housed within the
    white probe before retracting back and removing the white probe

Post-procedural Considerations

- ALWAYS confirm position radiographically via KUB before medications
    are given!

- Insufflation of air and auscultation of bowel sounds over the
    gastric area can be reassuring of correct placement of DHT prior to
    taping/bridling and leaving the bedside

- Most mispositioned/coiled tubes have to be removed and re-attempted,
    but it is ok to advance or withdraw if Stylet is still in place.
    However, once removed, a stylet should not be re-introduced to a
    mispositioned/coiled tube due to risk of GI perforation

- In case of cranial placement, don’t remove, consult NSGY

- De-clogging: Clog Zapper Kit (can type this into Epic directly);
    coca cola

Agitation Management – Jonathan Constant, Jonathan Smith

Background

- Agitation in the hospital result from discomfort, illness,
    medication effects or frustrations the patient is unable to
    meaningfully communicate

Presentation

- Impulsive aggression: spontaneous, explosive, reactive/reflexive,
    not pre-meditated

<!-- -->

- Delirium, psychosis, cognitive deficits, withdrawal/intoxication,
    pain, post-ictal

<!-- -->

- Instrumental aggression: pre-meditated, controlled, purposeful
    behaviors

<!-- -->

- Personality disorders, secondary gain, delusional thought

<!-- -->

- Differential diagnosis for aggression:

<!-- -->

- Psychoses: mania, depression, schizophrenia, delusional disorder

- Personality disorder: antisocial, borderline, paranoid, narcissistic

- Substance use disorder: alcohol, PCP, stimulants, cocaine,
    synthetics

- Delirium, dementia

- Frontal lobe syndromes (TBI, CVA, neoplasm, neurodegenerative
    process)

- Behavior/Developmental: Intermittent explosive, intellectual
    disability

Evaluation

- Examine (when calm) for source of pain, signs of infection,
    discomfort (ex: urinary retention or constipation), toxidromes

- Neurological exam for focal deficits, ataxia, nystagmus, tremor,
    rigidity, aphasias

- Review medication list and perform med reconciliation of home meds

- UDS + review of CSMD for evaluation of intoxication/withdrawal

- CBC, CMP, UA

- CT head + EEG if focal neurologic deficits

Management

- Environment

<!-- -->

- Periodic room searches; search personal belongings, VUPD presence if
    warranted

- Virtual or 1:1 sitter placement,

- Delirium precautions (see delirium section)

- Disposable trays and utensils (minimize potential weapons in the
    room)

<!-- -->

- De-escalation: Always first line, although impractical if pt is
    unable to communicate effectively, is explosive or already engaging
    in violent/potentially harmful behavior

<!-- -->

- Nonverbal:

    - Maintain safe distance, avoid sudden movements, don't touch the
        pt

    - Maintain neutral posture, neutral, sincere eye contact, same
        height

- Verbal:

    - Speak in calm, clear tone, avoid confrontation, and offer to
        solve problem if possible

    - Do not insist on having the last word

<!-- -->

- Tactics

<!-- -->

- Redirection: Acknowledge pt's frustrations; shift focus on how to
    solve the problem

- Aligning goals: Emphasize common ground and big picture; make small
    concessions

- Know when to disengage/leave room

<!-- -->

- Restraints

<!-- -->

- Should be used only when necessary to protect patient or others from
    harm

    - Mechanically restrained patients cannot be left unmonitored

- De-escalate (4 point to 2 point, etc) and remove restraints as soon
    as possible

- Documentation of restraint:

    - Face-to-face assessment has to be completed within an hour of
        violent restraint

    - “Restraint Charting” tab – typically in rarely used tab drop
        down

- Mechanical Restraints:

    - Soft restraints – most commonly used

    - Hard restraints – reserved for severe behavioral health (only 2
        sets in house)

    - Mittens

    - Posey Vest – prevents exiting bed, allows limbs to be free

    - Posey Bed – wandering patient (TBI, severe dementia)

- VUMC Orders: “restraint” --\> order set

    - Non-violent non-self-destructive (order lasts up to 48 hrs)

        - Most pts needing restraint: non-psychiatric, delirium,
            dementia, intubation

    - Restraint violent self- destructive adult

        - Order lasts up to 24hr with assessment every 4 hours

        - Mainly severe psychiatric symptoms

Pharmacological Management for Agitation

As discussed above, behavioral interventions are first line for
agitation management in the hospital. Pharmacologic treatment should
only be used when needed for patient and/or staff safety when
non-pharmacologic interventions are unsuccessful or impractical

Acute Agitation

- Antipsychotics

<!-- -->

- Widely effective for acute agitation, especially in delirium and
    psychotic disorders

- Monitor EKG if repeated dosing or if used with other QT prolonging
    agents

- Moderate agitation options:

    - Olanzapine 2.5 - 5mg po q6h prn. Orally disintegrating tab (ODT)
        available

    - Quetiapine 12.5 - 25mg q6h po prn for patients at higher risk of
        extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)

- Severe agitation

    - Haldol 0.5 - 1mg IV/IM q6h prn for older/frail individuals

    - Haldol 2-3mg IV/IM q6h prn for other patients

    - Titrate up to 5 mg and can increase frequency as warranted

    - When using IV Haldol obtain daily EKG, Mg and K levels

    - Stop IV Haldol if QTc \> 500 msec

<!-- -->

- Benzodiazepines

<!-- -->

- Lacks EPS that can occur with antipsychotics but can worsen delirium
    & disinhibit patients with neurocognitive-related agitation

- Can use alone or in addition to antipsychotic agent

- Preferred for agitation related to intoxication/withdrawal of
    sedatives

    - Lorazepam preferentially used due to PO, IV and IM availability

    - Lorazepam 2mg PO/IM/IV q6h prn typical starting dose (1mg if
        older/frail)

        - Can increase frequency if warranted. Monitor for respiratory
            suppression

<!-- -->

- If severe agitation not responsive to above, may require sedation
    with infusion:

<!-- -->

- Dexmedetomidine, Propofol or Midazolam

Maintenance medications:

- Antipsychotics

<!-- -->

- Reserve antipsychotics for severe aggression that pose significant
    risk and aim to wean as soon as safely possible

- Adverse effects: metabolic, EPS, increased mortality in dementia

- Most commonly used: Olanzapine, Quetiapine, Risperidone

<!-- -->

- Antiepileptic agents

<!-- -->

- May be effective in reduction of impulsive aggression

- Most commonly used: Depakote

    - Levetiracetam could worsen aggression/agitation

<!-- -->

- Beta Blockers and Alpha Agonists

<!-- -->

- Noradrenergic over-activity implicated in aggression expression

- Commonly Used: Propranolol, Clonidine, Guanfacine

<!-- -->

- Serotonergic agents: SSRI/SNRI/buspirone

<!-- -->

- Useful if co-occurring depression/anxiety disorders

- Peak onset of action takes weeks

Medical Decision-Making Capacity – Chelsea Sprick, Neil Phillips,
Jonathan Smith

Background

- Capacity is a patient’s ability to make a specific medical decision
    at a specific point in time and can be assessed by any physician

- Competency: “global decision-making capacity,” a legal determination
    made by a judge

Four key components to assess medical decision-making capacity

1.  Choice: patient must clearly indicate a consistent choice

- “Have you decided whether to follow the recommendation for the
    treatment?”

- “Can you tell me what your decision is?”

2.  Understand: Patient must grasp the fundamental meaning of the
    > information communicated by the medical team

- “Please tell me in your own words what you were told about:

    - The problem with (1) your health now and (2) the recommended
        treatment

    - The risks/benefits of (3) treatment, (4) alternative treatments
        and (5) no treatment”

3.  Appreciate: the medical condition and likely consequences of
    > treatment options

- “What do you believe is wrong with your health now?”

- “What is treatment likely to do for you?”

- “What do you believe will happen if you’re not treated”

- “Why do you think this treatment was recommended?”

4.  Reason: patient must rationally manipulate relevant information

- “What makes the chosen option better than the alternative?”

- “How did you decide to accept or reject the recommended treatment?”

If the patient does not have medical decision-making capacity:

- Identify and remedy cause of impairment if possible (if decision is
    non-urgent)

- Identify surrogate decision maker

Documenting medical decision-making capacity:

- Use a dot phrase .Capacity that lists the four components and
    document your thought process citing evidence from your interview

Medical Holds – Soibhan Kelley, MD

Background

- 6401 vs. 6404

<!-- -->

- "6401": process to detain someone who has a high likelihood of
    posing harm to themselves or others *due to mental illness*. Purpose
    is short-term detention until a prompt psychiatric assessment can be
    performed

    - One person completes this. Can be law enforcement officers,
        psychologists, physicians

    - Must document justification for why the hold is needed (progress
        note, assessment form, etc)

- "6404": 6404= Certificate of Need. Legal document used for emergency
    involuntary psychiatric admission

    - Pt must have mental illness or serious emotional disturbance
        (excluding intellectual/developmental disabilities) and pose an
        immediate substantial likelihood of serious harm because of this
        based on a face-to face assessment by a qualified psychiatric
        professional

        - Treatment must be necessary for symptom reduction and lack
            of treatment would lead to deterioration, with no less
            drastic alternative to inpatient hospitalization

    - Two certificates needed: the first to transport a patient to a
        psychiatric facility and the second for an involuntary admission

    - Two different *qualified persons* must each complete a form

        - Psychiatry residents can write these due to their special
            training licenses

<!-- -->

- No AMA Medical Hold: used when a patient does not have capacity to
    leave the hospital against medical advice *due to a medical
    condition* and needs to remain in the hospital

<!-- -->

- Can be ordered by any physician Medical Hold Order Set

VUH specific procedures

- A physical copy of the first 6404 is required to accompany the
    patient when they are transported to a psychiatric facility after
    medical discharge. The form is completed by the psychiatry team

Inpatient Insomnia – Julian Raffoul, Jose Alberto Arriola Vigo

Background

- Sleep disturbances in the hospital are multifactorial

- Consequences of sleep disturbances include changes in cognition,
    behavior, anxiety, pain perception, respiratory function,
    inflammation, and metabolism

- Goals while inpatient: optimize sleep environment, minimize
    stimulating or sleep-related side effects of concomitant
    medications, utilize non-pharmacologic strategies

Management

- Non-pharmacologic interventions:

<!-- -->

- Noise reduction: (ear protection, white noise, etc.)

- Keeps lights on during the day and off at night

- Reducing nighttime interruptions: Retime VS checks and lab draws

- Minimize devices (ex: telemetry) and lines as able

<!-- -->

- Pharmacotherapy:

<!-- -->

- Minimize medications such as sedatives/hypnotics, opioids,
    glucocorticoids, beta blockers, and certain antibiotics that disturb
    sleep architecture

- Melatonin: 1-5 mg PO qhs

    - First-line choice based on mild side-effect profile, low
        potential for drug-drug interactions, and improves circadian
        rhythms; Dose 2-3hrs before bedtime

- Trazodone: 25-50 mg PO qhs (max 200 mg/day)

    - Side effects: headache, dry mouth, and nausea

    - Monitor for orthostasis and infrequent atrial arrhythmias; use
        lowest effective dose

- Mirtazapine: 7.5-15 mg PO qHS

    - A primary alpha-2 antagonist with 5-HT2 and H1 antagonism

    - Consider when insomnia appears to be related to primary
        depression

    - Can increase appetite and cause weight gain

Additional Information

- Avoid the following in the inpatient setting:

<!-- -->

- Benzodiazepines

    - Reduces sleep latency and increases total sleep time but avoided
        due to significant adverse effects: respiratory depression,
        cognitive decline, delirium, daytime sleepiness, and falls,
        particularly in hospitalized older adults

- Non-benzodiazepines benzodiazepine receptor agonists (e.g.,
    zolpidem, eszopiclone/zopiclone, zaleplon)

    - Commonly used in the outpatient setting but associated with
        cognitive dysfunction, delirium, and falls in hospitalized
        patients

- Diphenhydramine

    - Trials evaluating their effectiveness as sleep aids are limited
        and show mixed results

    - Many potential side effects that are enhanced in the inpatient
        setting: impaired cognition, anticholinergic effects
        (constipation, urinary retention)

Substance Use Disorder (SUD) – Barrington Hwang, Kristopher Kast

Background

- SUDs are common, complex, and chronic neuropsychiatric disorders
    with well-described inherited risk, dysregulated neurophysiology,
    and multiple effective treatment modalities

- Pts w/SUD face significant stigma, prior traumatic experiences in
    healthcare environments

<!-- -->

- Using the term “abuse” undermines the disease model of addiction

- Person-centered, specific terminology: “person with opioid and
    alcohol use disorders”

<!-- -->

- Avoid the qualifier “Polysubstance.” Instead, clarify specific
    diagnoses for each substance category

- DSM 5 Criteria (same for most substance categories): Requires 2+
    criteria met in past year; use must cause clinically significant
    impairment and/or distress:

<!-- -->

- Loss of control – larger amounts, longer time, ongoing use despite
    consequences, efforts/desire to reduce use

- Physiologic changes -- tolerance, withdrawal (these 2 alone do not
    necessarily imply a disorder if they result from prescribed
    therapy), craving

- Consequences – hazardous use, interpersonal problems, medical
    problems, failed role obligations, lost activities

General Management:

- First priority in the inpatient medical setting is to identify and
    stabilize withdrawal states

<!-- -->

- Mitigate risks of severe sequelae (seizure, delirium)

- Avoid unintended iatrogenic harm (ex: opioid abstinence leading to
    lost tolerance and post-discharge overdose)

- Avoid distress-driven AMA discharge

<!-- -->

- Consider Addiction Psychiatry consultation for management of complex
    withdrawal states, substance use disorders and co-occurring
    psychiatric diagnoses, assistance with risk stratification for
    hospital misuse and/or hospital discharge with PICC lines for
    outpatient antibiotics, and differentiation of pain requiring opioid
    therapy and opioid use disorder

- If in the emergency room and not admitted, consult PAS

Opioid Use Disorder – Rita Hurd, David Marcovitz

Background

- Standard of care is opioid stabilization with buprenorphine or
    methadone (in OUD) or other full agonist opioids (in chronic opioid
    therapy)

- Methadone and buprenorphine can be ordered by any physician for
    inpatients

- Maintenance agonist therapy should be offered to every patient, with
    preference for an “opt-out” approach (even for uninsured patients
    through state grant funding)

Presentation (Withdrawal)

- Restlessness/psychomotor activation, anxiety, irritability, nausea,
    abdominal cramping, loose stool, diffuse musculoskeletal pain,
    chills, insomnia, yawning

- Pupillary dilation, piloerection, tearing, nasal congestion,
    diaphoresis, restless legs

Evaluation

- Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale (COWS): quantifies severity of
    opioid withdrawal and allows for safer buprenorphine inductions

- Asking about opioid exposure: “You’re uncomfortable. I work with a
    lot of people in the hospital, and some come with regular exposure
    to opioids from a lot of different places (their doctors, friends),
    should we be treating any withdrawal for you?”

Medications for Opioid Use Disorder (MOUD)

Buprenorphine

- Partial agonist at the mu opioid receptor with high binding affinity

- Long half-life (24-36 hours) allows for daily dosing

- TID dosing is more effective for acute pain (as the analgesic effect
    is shorter-lived)

- OK to use in renal failure/HD; may reduce dose in hepatic injury

- All non-pregnant pts should receive buprenorphine-naloxone (e.g.
    Suboxone) formulations to mitigate risk of diversion/injection

- Induction:

<!-- -->

- Hold all opioid medication 12+ hours prior to first buprenorphine
    dose (typically, this opioid-free period is overnight from 9 PM to 9
    AM), with a recorded COWS score \>8-10;

- 4 mg is given SL, monitoring for oversedation; additional 4 mg is
    given in 1 hour, and final 4 mg at 4 hours (total of 12 mg in first
    day)

    - Only sedation or hypopnea should prevent a full 12 mg dose

- Typical starting dose: 12-16 mg/day

<!-- -->

- Maintenance: 4-32 mg daily; 16mg and above to suppress opioid use

<!-- -->

- Requires waivered-provider

<!-- -->

- Acute Pain Management in pts using Buprenorphine:

<!-- -->

- There is no contraindication to full-agonist opioid analgesia for
    breakthrough pain

    - If the etiology of pts pain would require opioid therapy in a
        non-OUD patient, do not avoid opioids; these may be used safely
        in the hospital

- Peri-operative pain management: continue buprenorphine at reduced
    and split doses (4 mg BID or TID); will prevent withdrawal and
    cravings, but NOT manage new pain

- Post-operatively: reduce opioid requirements and increase
    buprenorphine to home dose

    - If buprenorphine was discontinued, will require induction
        procedure

Methadone

- Full mu opioid agonist with additional NMDA-receptor activity

- Better option for individuals who cannot tolerate the buprenorphine
    induction procedure, with significant chronic or escalating pain

<!-- -->

- Long t1/2: 12-36 hrs; max 10 mg/d q7d, to prevent dose-stacking and
    delayed overdose

<!-- -->

- Safe in renal failure; dose reduction for hepatic injury

- Potential for QT prolongation at higher doses, warrants QTc
    monitoring

- Induction:

<!-- -->

- In the hospital, start at 10 mg TID, holding doses for sedation or
    hypopnea; lower doses if concerned for respiratory compromise or
    concurrent CNS depressant therapy

- Limit 40 mg in first 24 hours; then titrate 5 mg/d q3d while
    admitted

<!-- -->

- Maintenance:

<!-- -->

- Must confirm dose with methadone clinic before restarting outpatient
    dose; until then, do not give more than initial doses (30 mg in
    single dose, 40 mg in first 24 hours)

- After confirming home dose, continue as single daily dose

Naltrexone

- Mu opioid antagonist; Half-life oral \~4 hours but clinically active
    \~24 hrs

- IM maintains clinically effective levels up to 30 days

- High affinity for mu receptor --\> CAN precipitate withdrawal
    requiring 7-10 days opioid abstinence prior to initiation

- If due for monthly injection while admitted, may substitute oral
    formulation until discharged to outpatient provider to receive
    injection

Additional Information

- Psychosocial Interventions that complement MOUD:

<!-- -->

- Consider referral to SUD counseling, mutual help (self-help,
    12-step, AA), intensive outpatient, and short- or long-term
    residential treatment

<!-- -->

- Use of other drugs NOT a contraindication to MOUD, however should
    encourage abstinence from other drugs during therapy (especially
    benzodiazepines)

- Prescribe intranasal naloxone for overdose prevention to all OUD
    patients discharging from hospital, regardless of MOUD status

Alcohol Use Disorder – Barrington Hwang, Kristopher Kast

Background

- 50% of hospitalized pts drink alcohol; at-risk alcohol use is \>14
    drinks/week or \>5 drinks in a sitting (for men; for women and men
    \>65, 7 per week, \>4 per sitting)

- Alcohol withdrawal onset occurs 6-12 hours after last drink, with
    90% having non-severe course; CIWA score \<10 at 24-48 hours
    indicates low risk of worsening symptoms

- Risk of seizures greatest at 12-24 hrs, occurring in \~3% of pts;
    risk of delirium greatest at 48-72 hrs, occurring in \~5%

- Risk assessment

<!-- -->

- RF: prior seizures/delirium, co-substance use (especially
    benzodiazepines), no abstinent days in past month, presenting BAL
    \>200, dysautonomia

- CIWA symptom-triggered protocol appropriate for pts at low risk of
    severe withdrawal

- For non-low risk pts, consider benzodiazepine/barbiturate load and
    standing taper;

<!-- -->

- Indications for admission: prior severe withdrawal (withdrawal
    seizures or delirium), comorbidities (medical and psychiatric
    illness), pregnancy, significant impairment in social/occupational
    functioning, communication barriers, social barriers

Presentation

- Acute intoxication: disinhibition, slurred speech, ataxia, nystagmus

- Acute Withdrawal: nausea, vomiting, anxiety, agitation, audio-visual
    and tactile hallucinations, headache, diaphoresis, fine motor tremor
    while arms and fingers outstretched, autonomic hyperactivity

- Chronic heavy use: Sequelae of chronic liver disease & malnutrition,
    including thiamine deficiency

- Caine criteria for Wernicke’s encephalopathy:

<!-- -->

- 2 or more: (1) malnutrition, (2) ataxia, (3) oculomotor
    abnormalities, (4) AMS

Evaluation

- Identify last use, quantity per day/week, other sedative-hypnotic
    use, history of withdrawal, social/occupational dysfunction, other
    toxic forms of alcohol compounds including methanol, ethylene glycol

- Acute Alcohol Withdrawal

<!-- -->

- Labs: Blood alcohol level, urine toxicology (+/- ethyl glucuronide
    to detect use in prior 3 days), BMP, CBC, HFTs (AST:ALT elevation
    2:1), CK and β - hCG

- CIWA score quantifies severity, though subject to inflation by
    subjective symptoms

Management

Acute Alcohol Withdrawal

- Most patients are appropriate for diazepam-based protocols:

<!-- -->

- CIWA-based symptom-triggered for low-risk patients

- Diazepam load + standing taper for non-low risk patients

<!-- -->

- Substitute lorazepam for pts with hepatic impairment (risk of
    long-acting accumulation)

- Benzodiazepine resistance: likely due to poor cross-tolerance, these
    pts require phenobarbital load ( 8-12 mg/kg (up to 15 mg/kg) divided
    into 3 doses 3 hours apart)

- Add folate, multivitamin, and electrolyte repletion

- If \>2 Caine criteria, treat empirically for Wernicke’s
    encephalopathy with high-dose IV thiamine (500 mg TID IV x 3-5 days)

- Consider Addiction Psychiatry consultation for complex presentations

Alcohol Use Disorder

- After withdrawal stabilization, engage pt in discussion around use
    and educate on connection between use and presenting medical
    problems

- All patients with AUD should be initiated on pharmacotherapy (MAUD)
    prior to discharge to mitigate risk of relapse, if consistent with
    patient’s goals

- Additional psychosocial treatments effective for AUD include 12-step
    groups (AA, SMART Recovery), cognitive behavioral therapy, sober
    living facilities, family therapy, contingency management, and
    IOP/residential facilities

- If patient does not have abstinence goal, reduced or controlled
    drinking may allow for harm reduction; naltrexone and topiramate
    have evidence for non-abstinence outcomes

- Pharmacologic Interventions:

<!-- -->

- Naltrexone (cannot be on opioid agonist):

    - Need 7-10 days since last opioid before starting

    - 25 mg x1 day, then titrate up to 50 mg daily; also available in
        q30d IM

    - Monitor liver enzymes; AST/ALT must be \< 3-5x ULN

- Acamprosate (cannot be used in severe renal impairment)

    - Head-to-head, inferior to naltrexone (see COMBINE trial)

    - 333 mg TID, titrating to 666 mg TID dosing

- Disulfiram

    - Infrequently used outside of extreme motivation (e.g.
        professional under monitoring); would not use outside specialist
        care

    - Must abstain from alcohol \~2 weeks after last dose, given risk
        of disulfiram-ethanol reaction (DER), which can be fatal
        depending upon disulfiram and ethanol doses

- Topiramate

    - Not FDA-approved for AUD, but has significant supporting
        evidence

    - Useful for individuals without abstinence goal

    - Titrate slowly over 8 weeks to 200-300 mg/d

- Gabapentin

    - Not FDA-approved for AUD, but with some evidence

    - Useful for post-acute withdrawal anxiety, insomnia, or
        co-occurring neuropathy

    - Titrate to 900-1800 mg/d divided into TID dosing, monitoring for
        sedation

    - Risk of sedation/apnea if concomitant alcohol use

Delirium – Julian Raffoul, reviewed by Wesley Ely and Jo Ellen Wilson

Background

- Definition: acute fluctuating disturbance of attention and awareness
    due to an underlying medical condition

- Presentation: deficits in attention, orientation, or memory;
    hallucinations or delusions; sleep-wake disturbances; psychomotor
    changes (hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed); language impairment;
    and/or emotional lability (agitation)

<!-- -->

- Think about the ABC’s of Delirium

    - Affect (anxiety, paranoia, irritability, apathy, mood shifts,
        personality changes)

    - Behavior (hallucinations, restlessness or agitation, psychomotor
        abnormalities, sleep disturbances)

    - Cognition (impaired memory, disorientation, disturbances in
        speech)

Evaluation

- Use screening tools to assess for delirium: Brief Confusion
    Assessment Method (bCAM). See critical care section for the ICU
    version, CAM-ICU

    <img src="output/media/image28.png"
    style="width:1.9635in;height:1.9635in"
    alt="Diagram Description automatically generated" />

- Once delirium is diagnosed, evaluate for the underlying cause.
    Delirium has many etiologies and may occur alone or in combination
    (in \~10% of cases, no clear cause is found)

<!-- -->

- Mnemonic for common causes of delirium:

    - D- Drugs/toxins (use of benzodiazepines, opiates,
        anticholinergics, steroids, etc., withdrawal from ETOH, benzos,
        etc.)

    - E- Eyes/ears (sensory deficits)

    - L- Low perfusion states (MI, PE, heart failure, sepsis)

    - I- Infection

    - R- Retention (urine, stool)

    - I- Intracranial events (trauma, seizure, stroke, hemorrhage)

    - U- Undernutrition/dehydration

    - M- Metabolic, endocrine (Hypo or hyper Na, hyperCa, uremia,
        thyroid, hypoglycemia)

- See neurology chapter for approach and work-up to AMS in general

Management

- Treat underlying cause as above

- See critical care section for prevention in the ICU (ABCDEF bundle)

- Cognitive impairment or disorientation: provide clock, calendar, and
    appropriate lighting. Regular reorientation. Provide cues from a
    familiar environment (pictures, calls or visits from family members)

- Encourage mobilization

- Review medications, eliminate sedatives and anticholinergics as able
    (review agents on Beers Criteria medication list)

- Remove medical support devices as able (foley catheters, telemetry)

- Maintain normal sleep-wake cycle. Keep lights on in the day and
    avoid excessive naps

- Ensure adequate bowel regimen and hydration

- Assess for pain and treat appropriately

- Ensure hearing aids, glasses, and dentures are available

- Note on pharmacologic management: There is no pharmacologic
    intervention known to prevent or treat of delirium. Reserve for
    agitation impairing patient safety when non-pharmacologic
    interventions alone are unsuccessful. See agitation section for
    medication approach

Hypoxia – Henry Brems

Background

- Two major ways to measure oxygenation, which are similar but
    distinct:

<!-- -->

- SpO2 or "pulse ox" - most common, measures the O2 saturation of Hgb
    at capillary level

    - \<95% is abnormal, but do not need supplemental O2 unless
        \<90-92% in most pts

- PaO2 - the partial pressure of oxygenation measured on an ABG

    - \<80 mmHg is abnormal

- The relationship between SpO2 and PaO2 is the classic S-shaped
    curve.

    - SpO2 of \<88% PaO2 begins to fall off dangerously fast

Evaluation

- Confirm true hypoxia with good pleth

- CXR

- Labs: CBC, BMP, BNP, troponin, ABG/VBG

- EKG

- TTE: obtain with bubble if shunt on ddx

- Lung US: B lines, lung sliding, effusions, consolidations
    (hepatization), diaphragm paralysis

- Chest CT without contrast for evaluation of lung parenchyma

- CTA chest if suspicion for PE (see PE section)

- Outpatient PFTs if suspected obstructive or restrictive disease

Management

- Should be directed at underlying cause

- If acutely decompensating, Duonebs, IV lasix, antibiotics depending
    on clinical picture

- Supplemental O2 for goal SpO2:

<!-- -->

- \>90-92% for most patients (There is generally no need to make SpO2
    100%)

- Between 88-92% for patients with chronic hypoxia from COPD (i.e., on
    home O2)

Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs) – Peter Edmonds

Full PFTs include:

- Spirometry: FVC, FEV1, with or without bronchodilator

<!-- -->

- Patients with new shortness of breath, chronic cough, or upper
    airway obstruction

<!-- -->

- Plethysmography: TLC, RV

<!-- -->

- Evaluation of restrictive diseases (ILD, neuromuscular) or
    hyperinflation (COPD, asthma)

<!-- -->

- Diffusion (DLCO) can be added to plethysmography

- 'Full PFTs' = Spirometry + Plethysmography + DLCO

Tips for ordering:

- Initial diagnostic workup: Full PFTs with bronchodilator challenge

- Chronic Lung disease: Spirometry to track FEV1/FVC over time +/-
    DLCO to evaluate ILD

Interpretation:

- Distinguish between obstructive and restrictive disease

<!-- -->

- FEV1/FVC \< 0.7 indicates obstructive disease

    - Normal to increased FVC & TLC is consistent with isolated
        obstructive disease

- TLC \< 80% is diagnostic of restrictive disease

    - Reduced FVC is suggestive, but not diagnostic of restrictive
        disease

    - FEV1 commonly too but FEV1/FVC ratio is normal in isolated
        restrictive disease

- Decreased FEV1/FVC and TLC suggests a mixed obstructive and
    restrictive picture

<!-- -->

- Assess DLCO -- abnormal is \<75%

<!-- -->

- Decreased DLCO can help differentiate between causes of obstructive
    or restrictive PFTs

Causes of common abnormalities:

- Obstruction

<!-- -->

- Decreased DLCO: COPD, CF, bronchiectasis

- Normal DLCO: asthma, early stages of COPD or CF

    - Asthma: spirometry may be normal, +bronchodilator response (an
        increase in FEV1 by 12% and 200ml after bronchodilator),
        +methacholine challenge

- Though we use FEV1/FVC to diagnose, we track disease severity using
    FEV1

<!-- -->

- Restriction:

<!-- -->

- Decreased DLCO: ILD

- Normal DLCO: pleural disease, chest wall (obesity, scoliosis),
    neuromuscular disorders

<!-- -->

- Decreased DLCO: If PFTs otherwise normal consider pulmonary vascular
    disease, pulmonary edema, or mixed obstructive/restrictive disease
    (pseudo-normalization of PFTs)

Basics of Blood Gases – Lexi Haugh

Did you order an ABG or VBG?

- Need to assess oxygenation ABG

- Need to assess hypoventilation May use VBG. ABG if shock, severe
    hypercapnia

- pH VBG usually correlates with an ABG (venous pH is \~0.04 lower
    than arterial pH)

<!-- -->

- Less accurate in shock or severe acid-base disturbance

<!-- -->

- ABGs are obtained by respiratory both at VUMC and the VA

- VBGs can be ordered like other labs on the floor. Ran as point of
    care test (iSTAT) in the ICU

Assessing Oxygenation:

- A-a gradient = PAO2 (alveolar O2) – PaO2 (arterial O2)

<!-- -->

- PAO2 = FiO2 (Pbarom - PH2O) - PaCO2/R

    - FiO2 = 0.21 on room air otherwise obtain from ventilator

    - Pbarom = 760, PH2O = 47

    - R (respiratory quotient) = 0.8

    - PaCO2 = arterial CO2 measured on ABG

    - Normal A-a gradient = (Age +10)/4

- See hypoxia section for ddx of increased A-a gradient

Assessing Acid/Base Status and Ventilation:

- Look at the pH (normal = 7.35 – 7.45): pH \< 7.35 = acidosis; pH \>
    7.45 = alkalosis

- Look at the pCO2 (normal = 35-45 mmHg)

| Primary Disorder      | pH      | pCO2 |
|-----------------------|---------|------|
| Respiratory Acidosis  | \< 7.35 | \>45 |
| Respiratory Alkalosis | \> 7.45 | \<35 |
| Metabolic Acidosis    | \< 7.35 | \<45 |
| Metabolic Alkalosis   | \> 7.45 | \>35 |

- Is the primary disorder acute vs. chronic?

- Is the primary disorder appropriately compensated?

- If not appropriately compensated, what additional process is
    present?

Primary Respiratory Acidosis:

- Acute versus chronic

<!-- -->

- Acute respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia will often present with
    somnolence or AMS

- Similarly, if a PCO2 is 80, and the patient is talking to you, it is
    most likely chronic

<!-- -->

- Acute Causes: Decreased respiratory drive (opiates, intoxication),
    respiratory muscle weakness (i.e., myasthenia gravis)

- Chronic Causes: COPD, sleep apnea

Primary Respiratory Alkalosis

- Acute Causes: Mechanical ventilation, anxiety/panic attack, pain, PE

- Chronic Causes: Pregnancy, CNS disorder, hormones (thyroid,
    progesterone)

Compensation for primary respiratory disorders

|         | Respiratory Acidosis                         | Respiratory alkalosis                      |
|---------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Acute   | 10:1                                         | 10:2                                       |
| Chronic | 10:3.5                                       | 10:4                                       |
|         | For every ↑of 10 in pCO2, HCO3 ↑ by 1 or 3.5 | For every ↓ of 10 in pCO2 HCO3 ↓ by 2 or 4 |

Primary Metabolic Alkalosis

- Appropriate Respiratory Compensation?

<!-- -->

- Expected pCO2 = 0.7\*(HCO3) + 20 (+/-5)

<!-- -->

- Etiologies: Associated with high aldosterone (either appropriate or
    inappropriate)

<!-- -->

- Chloride Responsive = appropriate hyperaldosteronism, can usually be
    fixed with Cl administration/ volume resuscitation

    - Etiologies: Volume contraction i.e., vomiting, over-diuresis)

    - Urine Cl \<20

- Chloride Unresponsive = inappropriate hyperaldosteronism, cannot fix
    with NaCl administration/ volume resuscitation

    - Etiologies: Steroids, Cushing’s, Conn’s, RAS, CHF, cirrhosis

    - Urine Cl \>20

Primary Metabolic Acidosis: See nephrology section, “Metabolic Acidosis”

Interstitial Lung Disease – Pakinam Mekki

Background

- Heterogenous group of parenchymal lung diseases that involve
    scarring or fibrosis, affecting the lung interstitium, alveoli, and
    pulmonary capillaries

<!-- -->

- Leads to loss of lung volume and compliance and impaired gas
    exchange

Etiologies

- ILD is divided into primary (idiopathic) causes and secondary causes

- Idiopathic: idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, eosinophilic pneumonia,
    idiopathic NSIP, organizing pneumonia, acute interstitial pneumonia,
    etc

- Secondary

<!-- -->

- Systemic:

    - Connective tissue disease: RA, Sjogrens, dermatomyositis,
        polymyositis SLE, MCTD, scleroderma

    - Granulomatous disease: sarcoidosis, TB

    - Vasculitis: granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic
        granulomatosis with polyangiitis, amyloidosis,
        lymphangioleiomyomatosis

- Exposure

    - Pneumoconiosis (inorganic) – exposure to coal mines, silica,
        asbestos, organic solvents, heavy metals, solder, hair dressing
        chemicals

    - Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (organic)- farm exposures, chicken
        coops, pesticide, stored grains, mold (ex: water damage in home,
        hot tubs)

    - Iatrogenic – amiodarone, immunotherapies, TKI, TNF-a inhibitors,
        nitrofurantoin, radiation

Evaluation

- Dry cough is the most common symptom of ILD. Productive coughs are
    uncharacteristic

- History:

<!-- -->

- Duration, timing, severity of respiratory symptoms

- Exposures – pets, occupation, residence, smoking, drugs, travel,
    hobbies, dust, hay, grass,

- Screen for autoimmune symptoms (arthritis, myalgia, rash, Raynaud’s
    phenomenon

- Screen for vasculitis symptoms: hematuria, hemoptysis, mononeuritis
    multiplex

- Medication history

- Family history – premature aging, myelodysplastic syndrome (most
    common familial IPF association with telomerase mutations)

<!-- -->

- Chest Imaging:

<!-- -->

- CXR – could find peripheral reticular opacities

- HRCT protocol is used for diagnosis: evaluates the lung parenchyma
    while pt is supine, prone, with inspiratory and expiratory cuts

- There are two morphologic features on HRCT

    - Usual Interstitial Pneumonia (UIP): basilar predominant
        fibrosis, honey combing, and traction bronchiectasis. Minimal
        GGOs. Pattern seen in IPF.

    - Non-Specific Interstitial Pneumonia (NSIP): Marked by subpleural
        sparing, increased reticular patterns, and mosaic attenuation
        due to air trapping. Minimal or absent honeycombing

<!-- -->

- Labs

<!-- -->

- Rule out infection: CBC, RVP, sputum Cx, Histo antigen, Blasto
    antigen, Aspergillus galactomannan, 1,3-β-D-Glucan, sputum GMS,
    consider NTM, HIV

- Rheumatologic workup: ANA w/ reflex ENA, ESR, CRP, CK, aldolase,
    consider full myositis panel, RF, anti-CCP

<!-- -->

- Bronchoscopy

<!-- -->

- BAL is not diagnostic ILD (except eosinophilic PNA), may be helpful
    to rule out infection

- Transbronchial biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis. Surgical
    lung biopsy may be helpful in cases where the clinical evaluation
    and imaging are not effective (uncommon)

<!-- -->

- Misc:

<!-- -->

- PFTs with 6-minute walk test (prognostic value)

- TTE to evaluate for pHTN

- SLP evaluation for indolent aspiration

Management

- Acute flare – all non- UIP = may respond to steroids. Consult
    rheumatology if CTD origin for further options.

- Chronic therapy

<!-- -->

- Consider tyrosine kinase inhibitor (nintedanib; INPULSIS trial) and
    antifibrotics (pirfenidone; ASCEND trial) – reduces FVC decline but
    no change in mortality

- There is increased mortality in IPF with azathioprine/pred/NAC
    (PANTHER-IPF); steroids are not indicated

- Immunosuppression for autoimmune related ILD

- Antigen avoidance for hypersensitivity pneumonitis

<!-- -->

- Consider lung transplant evaluation for severe disease

Acute Asthma Exacerbation – Stacy Blank

Presentation

- History of asthma or a history concerning for asthma

- Progressive worsening of symptoms: dyspnea, chest tightness,
    wheezing, and cough

- Physical exam with wheezing, poor air movement, tachypnea, increased
    work of breathing, hypoxemia

- Often use of peak flows is cited in the literature (PEF \<200 L/min
    or PEF \<50% predicted indicates severe obstruction, PEF \<70%
    predicted indicates moderate exacerbation)

<!-- -->

- May be useful although often does not change management acutely

Evaluation

- Generally aimed at ruling out causes for exacerbation and other
    diagnoses; these are not required but should be considered in pts
    being admitted for inpatient management:

<!-- -->

- EKG, trop, BNP, D-dimer to assess for cardiac cause (ACS, CHF, PE)

- CXR to rule out underlying process (PNA, PTX, atelectasis)

- ABG/VBG not routinely needed unless ill-appearing, tachypneic, or
    lethargic/altered

<!-- -->

- Dangerous signs and possible ICU if:

<!-- -->

- Tachypnea \>30 and/or significantly increased work-of-breathing

- Hypercapnia or even normocapnia (these pts are usually
    hyperventilating; a normal CO2 in a severe asthma exacerbation could
    indicate impending respiratory failure)

- Altered mental status

- Requiring continuous nebulizers

Management

- Continuous pulse ox with oxygen therapy to maintain O2 \>92 %

- Continuous albuterol nebulizer or Duonebs until able to space to
    q1h\>\>q2h, etc

- Steroids with dosing based on severity of illness (there is no data
    behind exact dosing of steroids).

<!-- -->

- Start with IV methylpred 125mg q6h in severe exacerbation/ICU
    patients

- Can start with oral prednisone 60mg q12h in less severe
    exacerbation/floor pts

- Plan to transition from IV to PO and then likely to send pt home to
    finish course of 40-60 mg pred daily for 5-7 days.

<!-- -->

- IV mag sulfate 4g over 20 minutes for severe exacerbation

- Keep pt NPO until off continuous nebs/respiratory effort is
    improved. Consider IV fluids with pt’s comorbidities (HFrEF, renal
    disease) vs. increased insensible losses with resp effort

- If pt is not responding to therapies, has worsening respiratory
    status, or blood gas concerning for respiratory acidosis needs ICU
    care for BiPAP vs mechanical ventilation

- Note: We do not start empiric antibiotics unless there is concern
    for bacterial infection

Prior to discharge:

- Ensure that pt is on appropriate controller medications (see
    outpatient management)

- Evaluate for causes of acute exacerbation to prevent future events
    (noncompliance, resp viruses, allergies, exposures, etc.)

COPD Exacerbation – Taylor Coston

Background

- Presentation: increased dyspnea, cough, and sputum production or
    purulence, diffuse wheezing, distant breath sounds, tachypnea,
    tachycardia

- Severe respiratory insufficiency: accessory muscle use, fragmented
    speech, inability to lie supine, profound diaphoresis, agitation,
    asynchrony between chest and abdominal wall with respiration,
    failure to improve with initial emergency treatment

- Impending respiratory arrest: Inability to maintain respiratory
    effort, cyanosis, hemodynamic instability, and depressed mental
    status

- Remember that patients with COPD can have other causes of
    respiratory distress including acute coronary syndrome,
    decompensated heart failure, PE, PNA, PTX, sepsis, acidosis

Evaluation

- Initial Assessment: ABCs

<!-- -->

- Airway/Breathing: Ensure patient is protecting airway

    - If obtunded or in severe respiratory distress intubation

    - BiPAP typically appropriate for severe COPD exacerbation unless
        contraindication (vomiting, obtundation, facial trauma)

        - BiPAP is ordered as IPAP and EPAP, 12/5 is often a good
            start

- Circulation

    - For hemodynamic instability immediate rapid sequence intubation.
        Pt’s can be hypotensive for a host of reasons (pneumothorax,
        sepsis, circulatory collapse from hypoxia and bradycardia, etc)

<!-- -->

- Subsequent Workup:

<!-- -->

- Continuous pulse oximetry, ABG/VBG, EKG, CXR, CBC, BMP, troponin,
    BNP, sputum cx, RPP, blood cultures if hemodynamically unstable

- Lung ultrasound to differentiate COPD from pulmonary edema when a pt
    presents with wheezing and respiratory failure (pulmonary edema will
    have B lines)

- Consider trigger: viral infection (70%), PNA, PE (have a high index
    of suspicion for PE)

Management

- Bronchodilators

<!-- -->

- Order “Respiratory Care Therapy Management Protocol” at VUMC

    - RT evaluates the pt and based on physical exam will give a
        duoneb. Continues to assess the pt and treats based on severity
        of the exacerbation

- If ordering bronchodilators individually:

    - Albuterol 2.5 mg diluted to 3 mL via nebulizer or 4 to 8
        inhalations from MDI every 4 hours while awake (RT) or more
        frequently if needed

    - Ipratropium 500 mcg via nebulizer, or 4-8 inhalations from MDI
        q4 hrs while awake

    - Can additionally order Duoneb (albuterol and ipratroprium) q4-6
        hours at VUMC

    - There is no respiratory order protocol at the VA, order
        individually as above

<!-- -->

- Steroids

<!-- -->

- For severe exacerbation give methylprednisolone 125 mg IV BID (or
    60mg IV q6h)

- For moderate to mild COPD exacerbations give prednisone 40mg PO
    daily for 5 days (including the initial IV dose if pt received one
    in the ER)

<!-- -->

- Antibiotics

<!-- -->

- For moderate to severe exacerbations

- Azithromycin (500mg x 1 then 250mg daily x 4 or 500mg daily x 3) or
    doxycycline 200 mg BID if concern for QT prolongation. Can consider
    respiratory fluroquinolone in certain high-risk patients but
    typically too broad

- Refer to Pneumonia in Infection Disease chapter if treating
    concomitant pneumonia

<!-- -->

- Discharge Planning:

<!-- -->

- Controller medications/inhalers (see COPD in Outpatient chapter)

    - Make sure any new inhalers are covered by insurance prior to
        discharge

    - Provide inhaler education and consider use of a spacer

- Vaccinations (influenza, COVID, pneumococcal)

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Exacerbation

Background

- Presentation: acute worsening of pulmonary symptoms such as
    new/increased cough, sputum production (or change in sputum
    quality), dyspnea. May have constitutional symptoms including
    fatigue, poor appetite

Evaluation

- “Cystic Fibrosis” Admission order set in epic is useful and contains
    most of the work-up and management listed below

- Labs: Sputum culture (specify CF culture), RPP

- CXR PA and lateral

- Always ask about coughing up blood and amount -- see 'Hemoptysis'
    section if present

Management

- All patients need a cystic fibrosis pulmonary consult (unless on
    Rogers Pulmonary if attending specializes in CF). FYI there is no
    fellow so don’t worry when you have to page an attending

- All CF pts are placed on contact precautions

- Antibiotics

<!-- -->

- Check CF notes, recent hospitalizations, culture data – MRSA, MSSA,
    and Pseudomonas are the most common

- If they were recently admitted and improved on that antibiotic
    regimen, it is usually a good empiric choice. CF team will
    ultimately guide regimen

- General coverage:

    - MRSA vancomycin (Bactrim or linezolid for allergies)

- Pseudomonas Penicillin class (cephalosporin, carbapenem, extended
    penicillin) AND aminoglycoside or Ciprofloxacin (double coverage)

- Be aware that the antibiotic doses are not the typical doses used
    for other indications. Use Epic Order Adult Cystic Fibrosis order
    set for Antibiotic/dosing (or consult with CF team, pharmacy)

- Continue tobramycin nebs (if on that month) and MWF Azithromycin
    unless otherwise contraindicated if they are on these therapies at
    home

<!-- -->

- Airway/sputum clearance

<!-- -->

- Albuterol nebs, pulmozyme (if on at home), hypertonic saline (if on
    at home), Vest, positive end expiratory pressure valve (PEP, ex:
    Flutter, Acapella), chest percussive devices (the wand) as last
    choice (not as effective)

<!-- -->

- CF modulators (e.g., ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elaxacaftor): continue if
    on at home, needs a non-formulary order so pt can use own supply;
    time with fat rich meal for absorption

- Nutrition/GI

<!-- -->

- Pancreatic enzymes (most pts are on them), order at bedside for pt
    administration

- Always continue ADEK vitamins

- Daily to 3 times a week weight checks

- Nutrition consult

DIOS - Distal Intestinal Obstruction Syndrome

-  Acute obstruction (complete or incomplete) in ileocecum by
    inspissated intestinal contents. Presents with abdominal
    pain/distension, constipation, poor appetite, possibly vomiting
    often looks like mechanical obstruction

- Treat with Miralax and/or Golytely

- RARELY surgery, try medical management first

Pulmonary Hypertension – Pakinam Mekki

Background

- Symptoms: insidious dyspnea, exertional chest pain, orthopnea, PND,
    edema

- Exam: JVD, increased P2, split S2, RV heave, TR murmur,
    hepatomegaly, ascites, edema

- Signs of RV failure: low cardiac output (hypotension, renal failure,
    hepatic congestion), arrhythmias, refractory hypoxemia (R→L shunt),
    effusions (pericardial \> pleural) 

- WHO Groups and Causes: 

<!-- -->

- Group 1: Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): obliteration of
    blood vessels in the lung 

    - Idiopathic, heritable 

    - Drugs/toxins (methamphetamine) 

    - Associated with CTD, HIV, portal HTN, congenital heart disease,
        schistosomiasis 

    - Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD), pulmonary capillary
        hemangiomatosis 

- Group 2: Left heart disease: back pressure and passive congestion 

    - HFrEF, HFpEF, valvular disease, LA stiffness 

- Group 3: Chronic lung disease: chronic hypoxemia, chronic pulmonary
    vasoconstriction 

    - COPD, ILD, OSA, chronic high-altitude, developmental lung
        disorders 

- Group 4: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) 

- Group 5: Multifactorial

    - Hematologic disorders, chronic hemolytic anemia, sarcoidosis,
        pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis, fibrosing
        mediastinitis, metabolic disorders 

Evaluation

- Most common reason for admission with a known diagnosis of pHTN is
    volume overload/RV failure and hypoxia

<!-- -->

- Consider etiology of decompensation: Progression of underlying
    disease, medication/dietary nonadherence, infection, arrhythmia,
    myocardial infarction/RV ischemia, shunting via opening a PFO as a
    release valve, pulmonary embolism

<!-- -->

- Consult pulmonary hypertension with any questions or assistance with
    workup

- Studies to consider ordering to determine etiology of pulmonary
    hypertension

<!-- -->

- Labs: BNP, liver enzymes, rheumatologic serologies (ANA w/ reflex
    ENA, RF/CCP, ANCA, Scl-70, Ro/LA)

Poor Prognostic Indicators for pHTN

- NYHA Functional Class (FC III-IV) - 6-minute walk test \< 300

- AKI - Hyponatremia

- Low SBP (SBP \< 90) - CTD or liver disease as etiology

- Poor hemodynamics on RHC (RAP \> 20; cardiac index \< 2)

- TTE findings - TAPSE \< 1.8, pericardial effusion, severe RV
    dysfunction

Management

- Goal of hospitalization is to understand and optimize hemodynamics

- Overall goal- improve NYHA functional class, RV function, 6-minute
    walk test, quality of life

- General management: treat underlying cause, diuretics for right
    heart failure, goal SpO2\>90%

- PAH medicines: Consult pulmonary hypertension if considering
    starting of changing meds

- Oral treatments may be used as monotherapy or in combination 

<!-- -->

- Calcium-channel blockers → patients with + vasoreactive challenge 

- NO-cGMP enhancers: PDE5-inhibitors sildenafil or tadalafil,
    riociguat 

- Endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs): Bosentan, macitenatan,
    ambrisentan –

- Prostacyclin analogs

    - Prostacyclin analogs increase cAMP-mediated pulmonary
        vasodilation. Side effects include jaw pain, flushing,
        arthralgia, diarrhea.

    - IV formulations are administered through a continuous pump.
        Never stop IV prostacyclins, even brief pauses can cause rebound
        vasoconstriction and death. In an emergency, can run temporarily
        through PIV

        - Epoprostenol: IV (Veletri) or inhaled (Flolan), half-life 4
            minutes.

        - Treprostinil: IV/subcutaneous/inhaled/PO, half-life 4 hours 

        - Iloprost: inhaled, half-life minutes 

        - Selexipag (Uptravi): PO, half-life hours 

<!-- -->

- Treatment based on NYHA functional classification: 

<!-- -->

- Class I: no treatment or monotherapy 

- Class II: monotherapy or combination oral therapy 

- Class III: combination oral therapy or prostacyclin 

- Class IV: prostacyclin +/- oral therapy 

<!-- -->

- Lung transplant for patients who are candidates and failing maximal
    medical therapy 

- VA ECMO can be used as bridge to medical therapy or lung transplant 

- Atrial septostomy- serves as “pop-off” valve and allows for
    decompression of failing RV; used as definitive palliative procedure
    or bridge to transplant 

Hemoptysis – Henry Brems

Background

- Distinguish between massive (\>600cc/24hr or \>100cc/hr) and
    non-massive hemoptysis. Can be difficult to quantify expectorated
    blood volume and volume that is retained in lungs

- Massive is potentially life-threatening due to impaired ventilation

- Remember UGIB (hematemesis) and nasopharyngeal bleeds can easily
    mimic hemoptysis

- Presentation based on source of bleed:

Evaluation

- Check for anticoagulation on med list

- Labs: CBC, BMP, Coags, UA (for hematuria), ABG (evaluate
    oxygenation), type and screen

<!-- -->

- Consider ANA, ANCA, Anti-GBM, sputum culture (bacteria, fungal,
    AFB), sputum cytology depending on clinical context

<!-- -->

- Imaging: CXR first (to evaluate etiology and to localize the source
    to a side). Chest CT depending on prior workup, severity of bleed,
    and stability of patient

- Bronchoscopy is sometimes indicated to localize bleeding source

Management

- Urgent evaluation if any hemodynamic compromise, hypoxia,
    hypercarbia, or respiratory distress

- Ensure a secure airway: massive hemoptysis may require intubation
    and MICU transfer

- Reverse underlying coagulopathy if present. Consider trending HCT

- If unilateral bleed, place bleeding lung down (i.e. if the source is
    left lung, place pt on left side) to prevent filling 'good' lung
    with blood (include this info in sign-out if known)

- Urgent pulmonary consult if clinical instability: Bronchoscopy is
    diagnostic and therapeutic

- Obtain CT Bronchial Artery Protocol if concern for bronchial artery
    source (especially in CF patients) so embolization can be planned

<!-- -->

- Order this at VUMC with a CTA Chest (NOT a CTA PE as that will be
    timed incorrectly) and include "bronchial artery protocol" in
    comments for the study

<!-- -->

- Consider IR consult for angiography as diagnostic and therapeutic
    option

<!-- -->

- Consult early if there is massive hemoptysis; If bronchoscopy is
    attempted but fails to stop the bleed, they can get to angiography
    fastest if IR has already been made aware

Pleural Effusions – Eddie Qian

Background

- There is a normal influx of fluid into the pleural space due to
    leaky capillary membranes and the pleural space’s negative pressure.
    This fluid is constantly reabsorbed by lymphatics. An imbalance in
    the system will result in accumulation.

- Some examples:

<!-- -->

- Increased influx: increased filtration from the capillaries from
    high intravascular hydrostatic pressure (i.e., heart failure, renal
    failure) or low intravascular oncotic pressure

- Other liquid entry into the pleural space through anatomic deficits:
    CSF, chyle, urine, blood, ascites (the diaphragm is naturally
    porous)

- Decreased efflux: obstruction of the parietal pleural stoma (from
    protein or cellular debris in exudative pleural effusions)

- Increased systemic venous pressure (lymphatic system drains into the
    systemic venous circulation so high venous pressure prevents
    lymphatics from draining appropriately)

Evaluation

- Imaging:

<!-- -->

- CXR: lateral decubitus position (if effusion moves with gravity,
    suggests free flowing)

- Ultrasound: assess size, location, loculations

- CT Chest with contrast (not always indicated; helpful to eval
    septations)

<!-- -->

- Thoracentesis (see Procedures section):

<!-- -->

- Will it change management?

- Pleural LDH, protein, cell count/diff, culture (don’t forget to
    order serum LDH & protein)

- Consider: pleural cytology, hematocrit, triglycerides, glucose,
    amylase

- If septated or empyema, consider pulm consult for chest tube

<!-- -->

- Interpretation of pleural studies:

<!-- -->

- Lights criteria: 1 of the following to be considered an exudative
    effusion

    - Pleural to serum protein ratio \> 0.5

    - Pleural to serum LDH ratio \> 0.6

    - Pleural LDH \> 2/3 upper limit of normal range of serum LDH

- Transudative: CHF exacerbation, hepatic hydrothorax, atelectasis
    (caused by increased intrapleural negative pressure),
    hypoalbuminemia, renal failure

- Exudative: infections (bacterial, TB, fungal), malignant,
    rheumatologic, PE

- Other tips:

    - Protein: \>5 think TB or malignancy, \< 0.5 think urine, CSF,
        peritoneal dialysate

    - Glucose: \< 60 think about malignancy, TB, or rheumatologic,
        less likely hemothorax or parapneumonic

    - Cell count/differential: polys represent an acute process,
        monocytes represent a chronic process, lymphocytes think about
        TB or malignancy, eosinophils think about air/blood, TB,
        malignancy, asbestos, drugs

<!-- -->

- Two separate processes may co-occur, and a transudate may mask an
    exudative effusion; if concerned for this and you have clinical
    stability, trial diuresis prior to thoracentesis

Lung Masses – Chandler Montgomery

Background

- Definitions: lesion \< 3 cm = pulmonary nodule. Lesion \> 3 cm =
    lung mass

<!-- -->

- Pulmonary nodules are common and often benign, but presence of lung
    mass (\>3cm) should prompt workup as chance of malignancy is high
    (\>50%)

- For nodules, refer to the Fleischner Society guidelines (incidental
    nodules) or Lung-RADS (detected on lung cancer screening) for
    surveillance/management recommendations

- Note that in TN, prior histoplasmosis is a very common cause of
    pulmonary nodules

<!-- -->

- Differential diagnosis:

<!-- -->

- Malignant:

    - Primary non-small cell lung cancer (NCSLC): adenocarcinoma,
        squamous cell (SCC), large cell carcinoma

    - Metastatic: commonly melanoma, sarcoma, colon, breast, renal,
        testicular

        - Often multiple nodules/masses (e.g., cannonball) 

    - Neuroendocrine: small cell lung cancer (SCLC), carcinoid, large
        cell neuroendocrine

- Infectious:

    - Granulomatous: TB, non-TB mycobacterium, endemic fungal (histo,
        blasto, coccidio)

        - May have component of calcification

    - Abscess: Staph aureus, Klebsiella, anaerobes, polymicrobial
        (aspiration)

    - Septic emboli, hydatid cyst, aspergilloma

- Other: hamartoma, AVM, pulmonary infarct, inflammatory nodule (GPA,
    RA), sarcoidosis

Evaluation

- History: smoking, cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, chest pain, weight
    loss, fevers, night sweats, hoarseness, bone pain, neuro deficits

<!-- -->

- Lung cancer should always be considered in a patient with smoking
    history & new cough or hemoptysis

<!-- -->

- Exam: cachexia, lymphadenopathy, bone pain, hepatomegaly, neuro
    deficits

- Imaging:

<!-- -->

- CXR has poor sensitivity for lung nodules, may show large mass or
    malignant effusion

- CT chest (with contrast if possible - better evaluation of
    mediastinum/LNs)

    - Review prior chest imaging to assess age and growth pattern of
        lesion(s)

    - Benign features: small (sub-centimeter), calcified, fat
        attenuation, stable over 2 years, multiple nodules

    - Concerning features: large, growth, spiculation, upper lobe
        location, thick-walled cavitation, mediastinal invasion

    - Location- adenocarcinoma often more peripheral, SCC often more
        central, SCLC associated with massive LAD, mediastinal invasion,
        large hilar masses

<!-- -->

- Look for paraneoplastic syndromes:

<!-- -->

- SCLC: SIADH, Lambert-Eaton, Cushing’s syndrome

- SCC: hypercalcemia (PTHrP)

- Dermatomyositis, polymyositis, hypertrophic osteoarthropathy

Staging/Diagnosis

- Imaging: CT chest (with contrast if possible)m CTAP w/contrast vs.
    PET/CT to assess for metastasis, consider MRI brain if clinical
    stage III or IV disease

- Biopsy: careful planning is key

<!-- -->

- For metastatic disease, obtain tissue from least invasive site

    - FNA or excision of palpable lymph node (cytology department,
        US-guided procedure, or EGS)

- If uncertain how to best obtain tissue, consult IR, interventional
    pulm, and/or oncology to discuss approach

    - Surgical Bx: Wedge resection/lobectomy often preferred if
        solitary nodule amenable to both diagnostic and therapeutic
        resection in good surgical candidate

    - Bronchoscopy with EBUS (endobronchial US) often used to obtain
        biopsy of mediastinal tissue or central/peri-bronchial lesion

    - Trans-thoracic needle aspiration (TTNA): peripheral lesions not
        amenable to bronchoscopy

Management

- Planning is complex, usually discussed at multidisciplinary tumor
    board

- NSCLC

<!-- -->

- Stage I/II: surgical resection +/- adjuvant chemotherapy

- Stage III: more complex requiring multidisciplinary approach

- Stage IV: chemo +/- targeted therapy depending on PD-L1 expression,
    presence of driver mutations for EGFR, ALK, ROS-1, BRAF, MET, RET,
    others

<!-- -->

- SCLC: usually widely metastatic at time of diagnosis, treated with
    systemic chemo/radiation

Inhaler Therapy – Patrick Barney

Inhaler therapy

- Current inhaler device delivery options

<!-- -->

- MDI – typical handheld inhaler

    - Pro is same dose of medicine each time you use them – if used
        correctly.

    - Con is that it requires coordination. Patient must be able to
        time 3-5s slow inhalation and 5-10s breath hold w/ release of
        medicine, can be helped w/ spacer.

- SMI – “soft mist inhaler,” handheld. Creates cloud of medicine that
    is inhaled without propellant.

    - Pros are more medicine gets into lungs than w/ MDI so lower dose
        can be used, does not require coordination.

- DPI - handheld inhaler, delivers medicine whenever patient breathes
    in through the device, requiring less coordination.

    - Pro is lack of need to coordinate breath; Con is inconsistent
        dose delivery.

<!-- -->

- Nebulizers

<!-- -->

- Saline

    - Hypertonic saline, NS, 3% and 7%. Can be used to thin secretions
        and produce deep cough in patients who need to expectorate as
        part of treatment. For CF, chronic tracheostomy, NM weakness. No
        evidence for benefit in COPD.

- Enzymatic Agents

    - Dornase alpha – Pulmozyme – “DNAse’ - enzyme that breaks down
        polymerized DNA in high concentrations in CF airways, indicated
        specifically for patients with CF

- Anticholinergics

    - COPD exacerbation, asthma exacerbation – bronchodilation and
        secretion inhibition in acute setting

    - Ipratropium (Atrovent) intermittent nebulizer or
        Ipratropium-albuterol (Duo-Neb) intermittent or continuous
        nebulizer

- Disulfide Disrupters

    - Sever disulfide bonds of glycoproteins in mucus, lowering its
        viscosity and making it more amenable to suction, expectoration

    - N-acetylcysteine (Mucomyst) - nebulized form available in “adult
        burn inhalation injury protocol” when search “mucomyst”

- Antibiotics

    - May be indicated in patients w/ CF, non-CF bronchiectasis, VAP
        as salvage therapy

    - Tobramycin – only nebulized antibiotic available at VUMC

Categories of inhaled medications

- Short-acting beta agonist (SABA): beta-2 agonism of bronchial smooth
    muscle to achieve bronchodilation; also decrease mast cell mediator
    release. Ex: albuterol, levalbuterol

- Long-acting beta agonist (LABA): - beta-2 agonists, same as SABAs
    but have lipophilic side chains that allow longer binding but also
    slow the onset of action. Ex: formoterol, salmeterol, olodaterol

- Long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA): - non-specific muscarinic
    receptor antagonists, leads to bronchodilation and reduced
    secretions. Ex: tiotropium, umeclidinium, glycopyrrolate

- Inahled corticosteroid (ICS): - suppress airway inflammation. Ex:
    budesonide, fluticasone, mometasone

VUMC Inpatient Options

- SABA : Albuterol (Proventil/Ventolin/Proair) - MDI, neb, continuous
    aerosol available

- SABA/SAMA: Ipratropium-albuterol (Duo-Neb) - neb and continuous neb
    available

- LABA – only available in combination w/ ICS. LABA/ICS:
    vilanterol-fluticasone (Breo Ellipta), salmeterol-fluticasone
    (Advair Diskus/HFA)

- LAMA: Tiotropium (Spiriva Respimat)

- ICS: Budesonide inhaler (Pulmicort) or neb, fluticasone furoate
    (Arnuity Ellipta)

Airway Clearance Therapy – Patrick Barney

- Indications

<!-- -->

- Cystic fibrosis, advanced COPD, chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis,
    chronic neuromuscular weakness, prolonged ventilator-dependence

- Goal is to assist patients with removing/expectorating mucus from
    lungs to decrease risk of atelectasis, mucus plug, increased airway
    resistance, infection

<!-- -->

- Chest Physiotherapy (CPT)

<!-- -->

- Use: pathologies w/ retained secretions and mucous plugging (CF,
    bronchiectasis)

- RT helps patient go through sequence of positions aimed at
    “draining” each of the lobes of the lung by gravity. Sometimes
    combined with percussion.

- Finding in Epic: chest physiotherapy \> CPPD panel – will initiate
    RT bronchial hygiene protocol and order TID CPT

<!-- -->

- High Frequency Chest Wall Compression (HFCWC)

<!-- -->

- Use: pathologies w/ retained secretions (CF, bronchiectasis, chronic
    bronchitis) or mucociliary clearance problems (lung transplant)

- RT wraps patient in inflatable vest, compressor rapidly inflates and
    deflates vest to “break up” thickened mucus from airway wall so it
    can be suctioned or expectorated

- Finding in Epic: vest \> Facility List \> vest physiotherapy or vest
    physiotherapy for CF under Procedures

<!-- -->

- Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP)

<!-- -->

- Use: pathologies w/ retained secretions as discussed above

- Patient exhales against fixed or fluttering resistor that allows air
    to get behind mucus, helps move mucus from airway walls, and holds
    airways open longer for improved ventilation

- Trade names- Flutter, Acapella, AerobikA

- Finding in Epic: PEP \> Facility List \> PEP therapy panel or
    Oscillatory PEP therapy panel under Order Sets

    - Can also find in a supply closet on 8S and bring to patient, be
        sure to teach them how to use it

<!-- -->

- Cough Assist

<!-- -->

- Use: most effective in patients with neuromuscular weakness
    affecting diaphragmatic strength – muscular dystrophy, myasthenia
    gravis, spinal cord lesions, SMA

- Via mask or trach/vent connection – applies positive pressure to
    fill the lungs, then quickly switches to negative pressure to
    produce a high expiratory flow rate to simulate a cough that is
    intended to produce expectorant

- Finding in Epic: cough assist \> Facility List \> cough assist
    treatment panel under Order Sets

Chest Tubes – Pakinam Mekki

Background

- Nomenclature: Small bore chest tubes= Pigtail Catheters (Often 8-12
    Fr) placed via Seldinger technique. “Chest Tube” technically denotes
    a large bore, surgical thoracostomy tube (Often 24-40 Fr)

- Indications: Pneumothorax, hemothorax (more often surgical chest
    tubes), empyema, malignant effusion (patient specific), chylothorax,
    penetrating chest trauma

- Contraindications: No absolute contraindications. Relative
    contraindications include hepatic hydrothorax, large emphysematous
    blebs, and anticoagulation or coagulopathy

Procedure

- Consult pulmonology for patients who may need pigtail chest tube

- Placement and Sizing

<!-- -->

- The location and size of the chest tube is related to the pathology

    - Pneumothorax anterior near the apex of the lung in the 2nd
        intercostal space, midaxillary line

    - Fluid (water, pus, blood), posterior near the base of the lung
        (fifth or sixth intercostal space, midaxillary line

    - Hemothorax surgical chest tube is placed to prevent clot
        formation

<!-- -->

- Potential complications: Laceration of an intercostal vessel, organ
    perforation (lung, heart, diaphragm, intraabdominal), trauma of the
    intercostal neurovascular bundle, subcutaneous emphysema,
    pneumothorax, infection, re-expansion pulmonary edema.

<!-- -->

- Smaller size results in less tissue disruption but more likely to
    clog or kink

**Understanding the Atrium:** After the chest tube is placed, it is
connected to the Atrium which can be connected to the wall for suction.
(See Diagram below)

<img src="output/media/image29.png"
style="width:2.78846in;height:2.62167in"
alt="A picture containing text, electronics Description automatically generated" />

<u>(A) Dry suction control-</u> determines the level of suction out of
the chest tube and is set by the provider. It is important to note that
while the atrium is linked to the wall suction via suction port (F) the
level of wall suction is determined by (A)

<u>(B) Water seal chamber-</u> if the atrium is disconnected from the
wall suction, it is on “water seal” (i.e., to gravity). This allows for
the one-way flow of pleural space contents out of the chest.

<u>(C) Air leak monitor-</u> if air bubbles are present in the water
seal chamber, then that indicates the presence of air in the pleural
space. The presence of air is different from normal “tidaling,” within
the water seal and requires troubleshooting (see below). Tidaling is
normal; it is the movement with respiratory variation in water seal
chamber. The water should rise with inspiration and fall with
expiration.

<u>(D) Collection chamber-</u> drains the pleural fluid contents via the
chest tube.

<u>(E) Suction verification window</u>- will be orange if suction is on
and atrium is functioning appropriately

Troubleshooting

- Air leaks: If bubbles are present in the water seal chamber, this
    indicates air in the pleural space. This is an expected finding in a
    pneumothorax; over time, the air leak should disappear as the lung
    re-expands. This contrasts with normal tidaling present with
    respiratory variation

<!-- -->

- There are two major causes of air leaks:

    - Persistent air in the pleural space, seen in alveolar-pleural
        fistula or pneumothorax (new or old)

    - Leak in the chest tubing at its insertion site or in the tubing
        system. To identify the etiology of a new air leak, try clamping
        the chest tube at various points, obtain a CXR

<!-- -->

- Clogging: Would see debris in the collection chamber and lack of
    tidaling in the water seal camber

<!-- -->

- In patients with viscous fluid output (ex- empyema), important to
    flush the chest tube with normal saline flushes at least twice daily
    to prevent clogging

- For clog- try flushing 10cc of sterile saline toward the pt or
    “stripping” the chest tube by pressing the chest tube with your
    fingers and pulling towards the drainage system.

- May require tPA or dornase for fibrinolysis, discuss with team that
    placed the tube

Chest tube removal

- Generally, chest tubes are removed when there is \< 150cc of
    drainage in 24 hrs (if placed for pleural effusion)

- For pneumothorax, there is typically a step-wise approach to
    removal. The team that placed the chest tube will guide removal

<!-- -->

- Suctionwater seal +/- clamp trial. CXR obtain after each transition
    to monitor for reaccumulation

<!-- -->

- Chest tube should be removed while patient hums (to prevent
    inhalation during removal that could introduce air into pleural
    space). Pigtail catheters have to be “unlocked” prior to removal to
    release the pigtail

Home Oxygen Therapies – Mackenzie Samson

Summary of Medicare Part B Guidelines for Home Oxygen:

- Conditions for which oxygen therapy may be covered

<!-- -->

- Severe lung disease including COPD and ILD, CF, bronchiectasis,
    widespread neoplasms

- Hypoxia related symptoms or findings expected to improve with O2:
    pulmonary hypertension, cor pulmonale, erythrocytosis, impaired
    cognition, nocturnal restlessness, morning headache

<!-- -->

- Qualifying Tests and Requirements:

<!-- -->

- Testing must be performed with a pt in chronic stable condition or
    within two days of discharge from an inpatient hospital stay (after
    treatment of acute exacerbating conditions)

- Criteria: Resting SpO2 ≤ 88% (or PaO2 <55) or SpO2 <88%
    with ambulation

    - Must be documented in chart

<!-- -->

- Special Considerations:

<!-- -->

- Medicare requires an additional walk on 4L/min showing desaturation
    if the patient needs a flow rate of 5L/min or higher

- Because of the risk of desaturation with exertion and the intrinsic
    error in the pulse ox (around 3%), patients with resting SpO2 ≤ 92%
    should have amb sats checked

- Patients with Raynaud’s or poor circulation may have inaccurate
    finger pulse oximeter readings. Consider using a head saturation
    monitor

<!-- -->

- VA Specific Guidance: Will need to document ambulatory saturations
    in notes as above. Call the Oxygen Clinic (number listed in all team
    rooms) and talk with your case manager

Summary of Medicare Part C Guidelines for Home Respiratory Assist
Devices i.e. CPAP/BiPAP:

        requirement

    - Sleep oximetry demonstrates oxygen saturation ≤ 88% for ≥ 5
        minutes of nocturnal recording time performed while on home O2
        requirement

    - For a neuromuscular disease (only), either: Maximal inspiratory
        pressure \< 60cm H2O or forced vital capacity \< 50% predicted
        and COPD may not contribute significantly

<!-- -->

- Severe COPD, covered if the following criteria are met:

    requires that OSA had been considered and ruled out (formal sleep
    testing not required)

<!-- -->

- Hypoventilation Syndrome: covered if criteria 1, 2, AND either 3 or
    4 are met:

<!-- -->

- Spirometry shows an FEV1/FVC ≥ 70% AND

- ABG PaCO2, performed during sleep or immediately upon awakening that
    demonstrates worsening PaCO2 of ≥ 7mm Hg compared to the original
    result in criterion 1 OR

- A facility-based PSG or HST demonstrates oxygen saturation ≤ 88% for
    ≥ 5 minutes of nocturnal recording time that is not caused by
    obstructive upper airway events

- OSA:

<!-- -->

- An initial screening for OSA in the hospital is nocturnal pulse
    oximetry. The distinct “saw-tooth” pattern representing intermittent
    hypoxia is suggestive of OSA, and a formal NPSG or home sleep test
    is recommended to evaluate for OSA.  This is done on an outpatient
    basis only once acute issues have fully resolved

Basic Chest X-ray Interpretation – Gautam Babu

An X-ray is a density-gram where “white” is “dense” and “black” is “not
dense.” Determine a systematic method you use every time you interpret a
CXR to ensure you don’t miss anything

- Start every CXR you interpret by assessing the quality of the film:

<!-- -->

- Penetration:

    - Should see vertebral bodies through the cardiac silhouette but
        not into the abdomen

    - If you cannot see them through the heart, the film is
        “under-penetrated,” and everything will appear more “white.”

    - If you can see them through the abdomen the film is
        “over-penetrated” and everything will appear more “black.”

- Rotation: Spinous processes should be in the middle of the
    clavicular heads

<!-- -->

- Two Different Systematic Methods:

<!-- -->

- ABCDE method

    - Airway – Trachea midline and patent

    - Bones – Bone density and obvious fractures

    - Cardiac Silhouette – Should see L & R heart border, if not there
        may be an adjacent opacity (Right Middle Lobe, Lingula)

        - Cardiomegaly = heart size ≥ 1/2 the width of the hemithorax
            on a PA film

    - Diaphragm – Look for pleural effusions at the costo-phrenic
        angle. If you cannot see the diaphragm along the way, there may
        be an adjacent opacity (Lower Lobe)

    - “Everything else” – Refers to the lung fields

        - Extra-Thoracic Soft Tissue – Subcutaneous emphysema

        - Fields and Fissures –lung fields should appear symmetric and
            “black”

        - Great Vessels – Tortuosity of the aorta and the outlines of
            the pulmonary vessels

        - Hilum – Hilar masses, LAD and pulmonary arteries

- Working around the film method:

    - Imagine the entire CXR film as a square and an inner “box” as
        the pleural lining

    - Outside the box: Lines/tubes, subq emphysema, gastric bubble,
        subdiaphragmatic air

    - Edge of the box: Look for pleural thickening, pleural effusion,
        pneumothorax, visualization of the diaphragm

    - Middle of the box: Trachea, vascular pedicle, hila, heart
        borders, great vessels, retrocardiac space

    - The lung fields

Silhouette sign: Two things of different densities will show a clear
border on a chest x-ray

- Loss of a border you expect to see suggests a change in density of
    one of the structures.

<!-- -->

- Ex: heart &l lung have different densities with sharp border. Loss
    of this border suggests that the lung “increased” in density

    - Ex: Pneumonia (fluffy opacities, air bronchograms, asymmetric)
        and pulmonary edema (linear opacities, fluid in fissures, Kerley
        B lines, cephalization)

    the superior aspect represents the left atrial appendage)

- LPA: left pulmonary artery

- RC: right clavicle

- RHB: right heart border (represents the right atrium)

- PHB: posterior heart border

- RHD, LHD: right hemidiaphragm, left hemidiaphragm

Basic Abdominal X-ray Interpretation

As with chest radiographs, use a systematic approach. Here are some
important reminders:

- Patient positioning (marked by tech):

<!-- -->

- Supine films poorly evaluate for free air, but are fine for
    evaluating bowel gas pattern, tube positioning

- Upright or left lateral decubitus are more sensitive for free air

<!-- -->

- NGT films

<!-- -->

- Film will not include the lower abdomen so cannot fully evaluate
    bowel gas pattern. If you don't see your NGT, confirm that the tube
    is not coiled in the oropharynx, esophagus or airway (check CXR if
    necessary).

- Post pyloric placement should be to the right of the midline with
    the tube resembling the “C-loop” of the duodenum.

<!-- -->

- Bowel caliber – small bowel distension more than 3cm caliber may be
    abnormal, is there distal gas? Recent operative intervention?
    Differential: ileus vs SBO

- Colon – identify by haustration. Cecum and rectum can be distended
    up to 9cm. Remainder of colon should be under 6cm. Stool burden?
    Twist/volvulus?

- Gas (where it shouldn't be) – look for lucency against straight
    lines (diaphragm, liver, falciform).

<!-- -->

- Large volume air can also outline bowel wall against intraluminal
    air

- Bowel wall shouldn't have gas (pneumatosis)

- Liver gas can be pneumobilia (prior ERCP/stent) or portal venous gas
    (from ischemic bowel)

<!-- -->

- Bladder – foley projecting in right location?

- Soft tissues – may faintly see kidney margins, psoas. No big/obvious
    soft tissue mass?

- Bones – rib fractures, spine compression deformities, pelvic/hip
    fractures

Consults for Radiology Procedures

- Radiology Procedures are performed by 3 separate consult services
    depending on the procedure requested.

- These pagers are covered 24/7, often by the same person for up to a
    week at a time (home call, not night float), so kindly reserve
    overnight pages for true urgent/emergent indications and save
    non-emergent communications until the morning

Specific Procedural Questions

Pre-Procedure (contact consult services for case-specific requirements,
guidelines below):

- NPO @ MN prior to procedure if sedation is to be used (majority of
    cases). Local only cases do not require patient to be NPO (see IR or
    CT/US procedures consult note for details).

- Labs required within 1 month of procedure or sooner if there is a
    clinical situation that can affect those lab values. Think Warfarin
    and INR, for example.

<!-- -->

- INR (\<1.5 for most procedures)

- Platelets (\>50K)

<!-- -->

- Anticoagulation

<!-- -->

- Google “SIR anticoagulation guidelines 2019”

- VUMC IR guidelines based on SIR 2019 guidelines are included at end
    of section

Inpatient biopsies for malignancy: Inpatient biopsies are lowest
priority on the CT/US procedures service given resource availability and
will more than likely get bumped. **We recommend that these get
scheduled outpatient.**

- Place an outpatient consult to image guided procedures at time of
    discharge/through discharge tab in EPIC to facilitate outpatient
    biopsies.

Drain Management

- Best to discuss directly with service that placed the drain (IR vs.
    CT/US vs. surgery)

<!-- -->

- Flush with 10 mL sterile saline q shift while inpatient (flush into
    drain towards the patient and then place back to gravity or
    accordion suction bag)

<!-- -->

- If drain output decreases, either:

<!-- -->

- The collection (e.g., abscess) has been drained

- The drain is clogged/malfunctioning/mispositioned

    - Start with making sure there are no kinks in the drain, the 3
        way is not clogged, and that the accordion drain is functioning.

    - Next, ensure the drain flushes appropriately. What this means
        is: you can flush the drain with 10 ml of saline and when you
        place back to gravity/accordion drainage bag you get back what
        you flushed in. There should be no leakage around the drain at
        the skin at baseline or during flushing.

    - If the drain is functioning, and there is still no output,
        obtain a CT w/ IV contrast to evaluate the collection and
        ongoing need for drainage,

    - If the collection remains, and drain is appropriately positioned
        within the drain, it is likely clogged/malfunctioning. First
        ensure proper suction/3-way direction. If this is not the issue,
        you can consider instilling tPA into the catheter for 2 hours

        - Would avoid in the setting of therapeutic anticoagulation
            given increased risk of bleeding unless discussed with
            procedural service).

        - Epic order: Alteplase (TPA) injection/infusion options
            Percutaneous drainage 2mg or 4mg

    - If this doesn't improve output in 48 hours, consider
        repositioning drain (VIR consult)

Additional References

Labs and Anticoagulation for CT/US and Vascular IR Procedures

Based on 2019 SIR Consensus Guidelines. JVIR 2019; 1168-1184. The length
of time anticoagulation is held may differ from these guidelines in
certain clinical circumstances at the discretion of the proceduralist.
Generally, may resume anticoagulation 24 hours after the procedure.

Serologic testing must be interpreted in the clinical context. ANA,
ANCA, and even specific antibodies without typical manifestations of the
disease are of unclear clinical significance

Anti-nuclear Antibodies (ANA)

- Always send with reflex (if ≥ 1:80, will check for dsDNA, Sm, SSA,
    SSB, Scl70, RNP)

<!-- -->

- At VUMC, 1:80 is considered “positive”; a higher titer is more
    specific for ANA-associated rheumatologic disease

    - \~30% of the general population has a “positive” ANA at 1:40,
        most clinically significant ANAs are at least 1:160

- Common Patterns

    - Smooth/homogenous – associated with Anti-dsDNA and Anti-histone
        antibodies

    - Speckled – associated with Anti-RNP, Anti-Smith, Anti-SSA/Ro,
        Anti-SSB/La

    - Nucleolar – associated with Anti-Scl-70

<!-- -->

- Specific types of ANAs:

<!-- -->

- Anti-dsDNA: High levels (\>150) are usually specific for SLE. Can
    correlate with disease activity, a/w renal disease

- Anti-Smith (Qualitative): Very specific for SLE but not sensitive

- Anti-SSA/Ro

    - Classic for Sjogren’s but non-specific; can also be seen in SLE,
        MCTD, myositis, etc

    - Maternal positivity for SSA is associated with congenital heart
        block in infants

- Anti-SSB/La: Similar profile to Anti-SSA/Ro but less common

- Anti-Scl-70: Specific for systemic sclerosis, most associated with
    diffuse cutaneous disease

- Anti-RNP: Required for MCTD diagnosis, can also be seen in SLE

<!-- -->

- Anti-histone: drug-induced lupus

- Anti-centromere: limited scleroderma, a/w pulmonary HTN

- Anti-RNA polymerase III: increased risk of scleroderma renal disease

Anti-neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA)

- Qualitative: p-ANCA, c-ANCA, negative, or indeterminate

- Quantitative titers: anti-proteinase 3 (PR3), anti-myeloperoxidase
    (MPO) IgG antibodies

- See vasculitis section for further details

C3 and C4

- Hypocomplementemia in active SLE (due to increased consumption)

- Complement may also be low in diseases that decreases the liver’s
    synthetic function

- ↓ C3/C4 in other diseases that form immune complexes, activating the
    classic complement pathway: mixed cryoglobulinemia, Sjogren’s, MPGN,
    and antiphospholipid syndrome

C-reactive Protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)

- Both tests are non-specific markers of inflammation

- CRP measures a specific acute phase protein made by the liver

<!-- -->

- IL-6 dependent (pts anti-IL6 therapy will have falsely decreased
    CRP)

- Typically changes more rapidly than ESR as it is a direct measure of
    acute phase reactant

<!-- -->

- ESR is the rate at which RBCs settle to the bottom of a test tube

<!-- -->

- Presence of positively charged proteins disrupt the self-repelling
    negative charges of RBCs clumping (rouleaux formation) increased
    rate of sedimentation

    - ESR will increase in states with increased antibodies, acute
        phase proteins, etc

- Falsely low ESR: low fibrinogen states (DIC, HLH), sickle cell,
    polycythemia

Creatinine Kinase (CK)

- CK can be elevated by vigorous exercise, rhabdomyolysis,
    endocrinopathy, cardiac disease, renal disease, malignancy,
    medication effect, neuromuscular disease, connective tissue disease

- Consider inflammatory myopathies if there is elevated CK and
    objective proximal muscle weakness

- Notably, CK is normal in polymyalgia rheumatica

Extended Myositis Panel

- Ordered as “Myositis extended Pnl-ARUP”; includes 19 separate Abs

- Can be sent when suspecting various forms of myositis such as
    dermatomyositis, polymyositis, anti-synthetase syndrome (ex- ILD
    work-up)

Cryoglobulins

- Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that spontaneously precipitate at
    low temperatures and become soluble again with rewarming

- Reported as qualitative (positive or negative) and quantitative
    (percentage = “cryocrit”)

<!-- -->

- Cryoglobulin last test is highly prone to collection error; must be
    collected in pre-warmed tubes and maintained at body temperature
    during collection and delivery to the lab;

- At VUMC can only be obtained at certain times M-F; lab & nursing
    staff can coordinate

<!-- -->

- Cryoglobulins are classified into three types: Type I, II, and III

<!-- -->

- Type I Cryoglobulins: Monoclonal immunoglobulins (IgM or IgG)

    - A/w lymphoproliferative disorders (Waldenström’s, MM, CLL, B
        cell lymphomas)

<!-- -->

- Types II and III are Mixed Cryoglobulins (they contain polyclonal
    components)

<!-- -->

- Essentially all mixed cryoglobulinemias will be RF+ \*

- Commonly associated with HCV (\~90%); also CTD

- Type II: *monoclonal* Ig with RF activity against *polyclonal* Igs

- Type III: *polyclonal* Ig with RF against *polyclonal* Igs

    \*RF activity by definition is the reactivity of an IgM component
    with the Fc portion of an IgG

<!-- -->

- Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis: small vessel vasculitis, vascular
    deposition of cryoprecipitates

<!-- -->

- Skin most common: palpable purpura, usually in lower extremities
    (colder areas), immune-complex mediated leukocytoclastic vasculitis
    on biopsy

- Additional manifestations include: Arthralgias, peripheral motor or
    sensory neuropathy, sicca, glomerulonephritis (usually MPGN)

Rheumatoid Arthritis – Raeann Whitney

Background

- Inflammation and proliferation of synovial tissue, loss of articular
    cartilage, erosion of juxtarticular bone

- Female predominant (\~3:1), mostly child-bearing age at onset

- Chronic, inflammatory polyarthritis affecting the small joints of
    the hands (MCPs, PIPs, classically spares DIPs), wrists, feet,
    ankles - typically *symmetric*

- Ulnar deviation, swan neck, boutonniere deformities are late
    findings of untreated disease

- Morning stiffness lasting \>30 min (often 1 hr+) suggests
    inflammatory arthritis (not specific)

- Extra-articular manifestations include: sicca symptoms, scleritis,
    ILD, pulm nodules, serositis, constrictive pericarditis, anemia,
    mononeuritis multiplex, rheumatoid nodules, rheumatoid vasculitis.
    Increased risk of lymphoma, osteoporosis

- C1-C2 instability: pts need evaluation with imaging prior to
    surgical procedure/intubation

Evaluation

- Clinical diagnosis + positive RF, anti-CCP. Note up to 15-20%
    patients have seronegative RA

<!-- -->

- RF is more sensitive but not specific; can be + in HBV/HCV,
    cryoglobulinemia

- CCP is less sensitive but more specific

<!-- -->

- CBC, CMP, CRP, ESR, HIV, Hepatitis B and C screening; Quantiferon
    Gold (biologics)

- Obtain hand and foot films to assess for periarticular osteopenia &
    typical marginal erosions

Management

- The majority of joint damage occurs early in the disease so early
    treatment paramount

- DMARDs: typically start with MTX; may require biologics such as TNF
    inhibitors

<!-- -->

- MTX dosed weekly; required daily 1 mg folic acid supplement

    - Toxicities: oral ulcers, bone marrow suppression, liver
        toxicity, pneumonitis, teratogenic (contraception required)

<!-- -->

- Symptomatic/Flare treatment (no impact on disease progression):

<!-- -->

- Steroids at low-moderate dosage (e.g., prednisone 15-20mg/day);
    NSAIDs (high doses required for anti-inflammatory effects)

Systemic Lupus Erythematous – Eva Niklinska

Background

- Characterized by multisystem inflammation, activation of complement,
    autoantibody formation

- Presentation:

<!-- -->

- Constitutional: fatigue, fevers, weight loss

- Neurologic: cerebritis, myelitis, mononeuritis multiplex, psychosis

- Skin: malar rash (spares nasolabial folds), discoid lesions
    (scarring), photosensitivity

- Hematologic: leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia

- Pulmonary: pleuritis, pleural effusion, ILD

- Cardiac: pericarditis/myocarditis, increased risk for CAD,
    Libman-Sacks endocarditis

- Renal: nephritic/nephrotic syndrome

- MSK: arthralgias, myalgias, arthritis (nonerosive, often symmetric)

- Ophtho: keratoconjunctivitis sicca 2/2 concurrent Sjogren’s

Evaluation

- Labs to check upon admission: dsDNA (don’t re-send ANA/ENA panel if
    known ddx), C3/C4, ESR, CRP, CBC w/ diff, CMP, UPC

- 2019 EULAR/ACR classification criteria for diagnosis:

<!-- -->

- ANA (≥ 1:80) + additive scoring (classify as SLE if score is 10+)

- Do not count criteria if there is a more likely explanation for it

- Occurrence of a criterion on one occasion is sufficient. Criteria do
    not need to occur simultaneously. At least one criterion must be
    clinical

<!-- -->

- Ddx: RA, MCTD, SS, Sjogren’s, Vasculitis (Behcet’s), PM/DM,
    Fibromyalgia 

- \* Note + ANA is now entry criteria \[ANA only needs to be + once\]

Management

- Hydroxychloroquine mainstay of treatment, 200-400 mg/day; dose 5
    mg/kg/day for long term to decrease risk of retinal toxicity

<!-- -->

- Safe in pregnancy; decreases VTE/HLD risk 

- Annual ophtho exam for retinal toxicity 

- NOT immunosuppressive

<!-- -->

- Glucocorticoids for flares: Usually started with hydroxychloroquine
    and tapered once hydroxychloroquine has taken effect

- Other immunosuppressive medications (MTX, MMF, AZA, RTX) used with
    rheumatology consultation: MMF, cyclophosphamide or other advanced
    therapies used in SLE with renal involvement or severe end organ
    involvement

Scleroderma (Systemic Sclerosis) – Eva Niklinska and Raeann Whitney

Background

- Distinguish from localized scleroderma (morphea or linear
    scleroderma) = dermal fibrosis w/o internal organ involvement)

- 2 Major Subtypes of Generalized / Systemic Scleroderma (SSc):

<!-- -->

- Limited Cutaneous (lcSSc): skin thickening limited to the neck,
    face, or distal to elbows and knees; spares the truck and proximal
    extremities

    - Limited does not equal mild, limited refers to distribution of
        skin involvement

    - Renal crisis is rare

    - Patients with + ACA (anticentromere Ab) are at high risk for
        developing PAH

    - Patients with + Anti-Scl-70 Ab are also at high risk for
        progressive ILD

- Diffuse Cutaneous: skin thickening extends proximal to the
    elbows/knees or trunk

    - Typically more abrupt onset and rapid progression compared to
        lcSSc

    - High risk for progressive ILD

    - \+ RNA polymerase III Ab = high risk of renal crisis, higher
        risk for malignancy

Presentation

- CREST: Calcinosis cutis, Raynaud phenomenon, Esophageal dysmotility,
    Sclerodactyly, Telangiectasia (CREST syndrome is no longer a
    discrete diagnosis)

- Systemic: fatigue, weight loss

- Vascular: Raynaud’s +/- digital tip ulcers, telangiectasias,
    nailfold capillaroscopy w/ dilated capillary loops

- Skin: Loss of facial wrinkles, decreased oral aperture

- MSK: arthralgias, myalgias, flexion contractures

- GI: Esophageal or intestinal dysmotility, GERD, GAVE (watermelon
    stomach)

- Pulm: ILD (NSIP, UIP), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)

- Cardiac: pericardial effusions, myocarditis, cardiomyopathy,
    conduction system disease

- Renal: renal crisis (onset of malignant HTN, greatest risk in first
    5 years)

- Labs: ANA w/ Reflex, Scl70, anticentromere, RNA pol III (separate
    order in Epic)

- Imaging/Procedures: Baseline PFTs, Lung HRCT, TTE, EKG, 6-minute
    walk test

- Skin biopsy: Not often used for dx, may be required to differentiate
    other rare disorders (eosinophilic fasciitis, scleroderma,
    scleromyxedema)

Management

- Organ-Based Symptomatic Therapy

<!-- -->

- Raynauds: CCB (amlodipine, nifedipine), topical nitroglycerin

- GERD: PPI

- Renal: Monitor BP; Cr

- ILD: Periodic PFTs, monitor for new respiratory symptoms, pulm
    referral

- Cardiac/PAH: annual TTE, cardiology referral

<!-- -->

- Systemic Immunosuppression (if progressive skin thickening or organ
    involvement)

<!-- -->

- MTX, MMF, cyclophosphamide, if refractory rituximab, IVIG 

Scleroderma Renal Crisis

- Typically presents early in disease course (can even precede skin
    thickening)

- Abrupt onset of hypertension and renal dysfunction

- Labs: Elevated Cr, proteinuria, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia,
    elevated renin

- Treatment: short acting ACE (captopril or enalapril, titratable),
    may require HD

Anti-Phospholipid Syndrome – Gautam Babu

Background

- Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) = a heterogenous group of
    autoantibodies which interact with endothelial cells through binding
    of β2GPI receptor

- APLs induce a procoagulant and proinflammatory endothelial phenotype
    arterial, venous, small vessel thromboembolic events, or pregnancy
    losses

Presentation

- Unexplained/recurrent venous, arterial, and/or small vessel
    thromboembolic events

<!-- -->

- Venous: DVT most common

- Arterial: cerebral, renal, mesenteric, coronary, PE

<!-- -->

- Pregnancy morbidity: recurrent, unexplained spontaneous abortions,
    fetal loss, preterm birth due to preeclampsia, placental
    insufficiency

- Other features: nonbacterial vegetations (Libman-Sachs
    endocarditis), thrombocytopenia, livedo reticularis

Evaluation

- Revised Sapporo classification criteria: At least one of the
    clinical criteria and one of the laboratory criteria are met:

<!-- -->

- Vascular thrombosis (arterial, small vessel, or venous)

- Pregnancy morbidity

- Antiphospholipid lab testing: must be present on two or more
    occasions at least 12 weeks apart (NOT TESTED INPATIENT) Lupus
    anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody (IgG or IgM, medium or high
    titer) anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-I antibody (IgG or IgM)

Management

- Mainstay is anticoagulation for treatment and secondary prevention

- Acute thromboembolism: Heparin gtt with bridge to warfarin

- Secondary thrombosis prevention, anticoagulation with warfarin is
    preferred

<!-- -->

- Studies suggest that DOACs are less effective than warfarin

- Goal INR 2-3 regardless of whether arterial or venous
    thromboembolism present

<!-- -->

- ASA 81 mg + warfarin for pts w/arterial events and risks for ASCVD

Catastrophic Anti-phospholipid Syndrome (CAPS) – Gautam Babu

Background

- Rapid development of thromboses in multiple small blood vessels in
    various organs resulting in multi-organ failure. Occurs in a small
    subset of patients with APS

Presentation

- Similar presentation to APS, but multiple organs are involved in a
    short period of time

- Renal (hypertension, proteinuria, hematuria, acute renal failure),
    Pulmonary (ARDS, PE), Central Nervous System (encephalopathy,
    stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis), Cardiac (coronary thrombosis),
    and Cutaneous (livedo reticularis, acrocyanosis, purpura,
    ecchymosis, splinter hemorrhages, and necrosis resulting in
    ulceration)

Evaluation

- Exclude other causes of small vessel occlusion: HIT, DIC or TMA

- Definite dx= all 4 criteria met, probable dx=combination of criteria
    present

<!-- -->

- Evidence of involvement of three or more organs, systems, and/or
    tissues

- Development of manifestations simultaneously or in less than a week

- Confirmation by histopathology of small vessel occlusion in at least
    one organ or tissue

- Laboratory confirmation of the presence of antiphospholipid
    antibodies

Management

- Anticoagulation: Heparin acutely. Warfarin once stable & no bleeding
    or recurrent thromboses

- Pulse steroids with methylprednisolone x 3 days followed by
    prednisone

- Severe cases may require PLEX/IVIG. Refractory CAPS may require
    rituximab or eculizumab

Sarcoidosis – Jared Freitas

Background

- Multisystem disordered defined by forming noncaseating granulomas in
    different tissues

- Cardiac and neuro manifestations can be isolated

Presentation

- Constitutional symptoms: fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, fevers,
    arthralgias, myalgias

- Pulmonary symptoms (most common): dyspnea, cough, and wheezing

- Extrapulmonary manifestations:

<!-- -->

- Cutaneous: Highly variable, but present in 25% of patients

    - Papules, macules, or plaques commonly involving neck, upper
        back, extremities

    - Lupus pernio: indurated, violaceous bumps on nose, lips, cheeks,
        ears

    - Erythema nodosum

- Neuro

    - Affects 5-10% pts; involving any part of CNS or PNS

    - CN palsies, hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction, seizures,
        myelopathy or radiculopathy, hydrocephalus, aseptic meningitis

- Cardiac

    - Granulomas can affect pericardium, myocardium and endocardium
        resulting in valvular disorders, conduction system and
        cardiomyopathy

- Liver/Spleen

    - Granulomas in liver and spleen can lead to elevated LFTs,
        cirrhosis, anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (splenic
        sequestration)

- Ocular

    - Uveitis, secondary glaucoma, retinal vasculitis,
        keratoconjunctivitis

Work Up

- Combination of clinical features, radiographic manifestations,
    exclusion of other similarly presenting diseases, and noncaseating
    granulomas on pathology

<!-- -->

- CXR: hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy ± pulmonary infiltrates

- High-Resolution Chest CT

    - Lymphadenopathy (bilateral and symmetric), with micro or
        macronodules, fibrotic changes (reticular opacities, traction
        bronchiectasis, volume loss)

- PFTs

    - May show restrictive disease (decreased TLC & VC) and diffusion
        impairment (reduced DLCO). Occasionally obstructive with
        endobronchial disease.

- Labs: CBC w/ diff, CMP, UA, quant-gold for TB. ACE level is of
    limited clinical use

    - Important to rule out mimics. The differential for “noncaseating
        granulomas” is extensive, including lymphoma and fungal
        infections.

    - Not required for pts w/ asymptomatic bilateral hilar adenopathy
        or Lofgren syndrome (fever, erythema nodosum, arthralgias, and
        bilateral hilar LAD)

Management

- Most pts do not require therapy: monitor symptoms, CXR, PFTs at 3-6
    month intervals

- Indications for treatment: progressive disease or severe disease at
    presentation

- Mainstay of treatment is oral steroids:

<!-- -->

- Dosing usually 0.3-0.6 mg/kg daily for 4-6 weeks

- If only symptoms is cough, could consider inhaled glucocorticoids

<!-- -->

- If unresponsive or unable to tolerate steroids may require
    alternative agents (MTX, AZA)

Crystalline Arthropathies – Thomas Horton

Gout

Presentation

- Red, hot, swollen joint (classically affects 1st metatarsal
    phalangeal joint \[podagra\])

- May progress to involve ankles, knees, elbows, and small joints of
    hand if untreated

<!-- -->

- Flares may also become polyarticular over time

<!-- -->

- Gout is diagnosed with combination of clinical presentation and
    arthrocentesis results

- Lifestyle factors:

<!-- -->

- Protective: Low fat dairy, hydration, weight loss, smoking cessation

- Promoting: Meat, seafood, alcohol, high fructose corn syrup,
    medications that lead to hyperuricemia (ex: thiazides)

Evaluation

- Synovial Fluid Analysis: 

<!-- -->

- Cell count and differential: WBC 20,000-100,000, \> 50% neutrophils

- Order gram stain/culture (It is possible to have septic arthritis
    and gout)

- Examination for crystals under polarizing light microscopy: (order
    “Synovial Fluid Eval” so the lab knows to look for crystals)

    - Monosodium urate crystals: needle-shaped and negatively
        birefringent and appear yellow when parallel to the polarizer

<!-- -->

- Imaging: generally unnecessary

<!-- -->

- MSK ultrasound: "Double contour sign" (hyperechoic band = urate
    crystals deposits)

- Radiographs: Punched out erosions or lytic areas with overhanging
    edges

- Dual energy CT scan: gout crystal aggregates appear green. Not
    routinely necessary; Do not order without rheumatology consult

Management

Acute:

- Do not discontinue allopurinol during an acute gout attack

- NSAIDs (if not contraindicated): Short course (2-5 days) at full
    anti-inflammatory dose: ibuprofen 800 mg TID, indomethacin 50 mg
    TID, naproxen 500 mg BID

- Colchicine (avoid if GFR \<10 mL/min. Dose reduce by 50% if GFR \<50
    mL/min)

<!-- -->

- Best if used within the first 36 hours of an attack. Much less
    effective if started later.

- Dosing: 1.2 mg then 0.6 mg one hour later, then 0.6 mg daily until
    clinical improvement

    - Note drug interactions that may require dose adjustment of
        colchicine: Statins, diltiazem, fluconazole, cyclosporine,
        tacrolimus, clarithromycin, etc.

<!-- -->

- Steroids:

<!-- -->

- Ideally intra-articular if single joint affected and infection has
    been ruled out

- Oral prednisone, dose 0.5mg/kg/day until clinical improvement then
    taper over 7-14 days

<!-- -->

- Anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist): 100mg once daily for three days
    (or QOD for CrCl \<30). Requires rheumatology consult. For patients
    with contraindications to all other treatments

Chronic:

- Urate Lowering Therapy (ULT)

<!-- -->

- Indications: Strong: \>2 attacks/year, one or more subcutaneous
    tophi, radiologic changes. Conditional: CKD 3 or worse,
    urolithiasis, serum urate \>9

- Goal serum urate: \<6.0 mg/dL, or \<5.0 mg/dL in patients with tophi

- ULT can precipitate an acute gout flare and should always be started
    with low-dose NSAIDs, colchicine (0.6 mg) or prednisone (5 mg daily
    or QOD)

    - Prophylaxis should be continued for at least 6 months until uric
        acid is at goal and tophi have resolved

- Allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor): Start low at 100 mg per
    day (sometimes even 50mg daily in those with advanced CKD) and
    increase as needed for target uric acid \<6 (most patients will need
    400-800 mg daily)

    - Adjust dose monthly (3-4 weeks). In kidney dysfunction go
        slower.

    - Titration of allopurinol ↓ both the risk of acute gout attacks
        and DRESS syndrome

    - Genetic testing (HLA-B\*5801) recommended prior to starting for
        pts of Asian and African descent given ↑ incidence of
        allopurinol hypersensitivity if + positive allele

- Febuxostat: alternative xanthine oxidase inhibitor that is
    metabolized by the liver for pts at risk for DRESS or SJS related to
    allopurinol. Black box warning for ↑ cardiovascular risk; more
    expensive than allopurinol

<!-- -->

- Consider Rheumatology consult for patients with refractory serum
    urate levels \>6.0 on XOI

Additional pearls

- There is a microscope in the rheumatology clinic at VUMC (TVC 2);
    You can page the rheumatology fellow and they are happy to help you
    use it

- Uric acid level is often normal during acute gout flare

- Shifts in uric acid may be the trigger of the flare: Diuresis,
    dietary changes, hospital stays

- Eliminating uric acid from the diet only reduces uric acid by \~1
    mg/dL. Urate lowering therapy will be needed in most patients even
    if diet changed

- VA specific guidance:

<!-- -->

- Colchicine is non-formulary but is easily approved

- For steroid intra-articular injections triamcinolone is the
    formulary option

Pseudogout- Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease
(CPPD)

Presentation

- Red, hot, swollen joint usually in the wrists, knees, or MCP joints

- Cannot distinguish from gout based on clinical features alone. Like
    gout, diagnosis is based on exam and arthrocentesis

- More prevalent in the elderly populations

Evaluation

- Synovial Fluid:

<!-- -->

- Cell count and differential: WBC 20,000 to 100,000, \>50%
    neutrophils

- Order gram stain/culture (It is possible to have septic arthritis
    and CPPD)

- Examination for crystals under polarizing light microscopy

    - CPPD crystals: rhomboid-shaped, weakly positively birefringent
        and appear blue when parallel to the polarizer

<!-- -->

- Imaging: 

<!-- -->

- XR: chondrocalcinosis (thin calcified line present in
    fibrocartilage) in the joint space (easiest to see in knee and
    wrists)

Management

- Typically follows the same treatment used for acute gout attacks
    (see above, little evidence)

- Some patients may develop Chronic CPP Crystal Inflammatory
    Arthritis.

    - Resembles RA in presentation

    - Treatment base on symptoms and ranges from NSAIDs (1st line) to
        > Colchicine, HCQ, and steroids. Can also use anakinra in acute
        > cases, with consult to rheumatology

        Additional Information

- CPPD can be associated with other disorders: hyperparathyroidism,
    hemochromatosis, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and familial
    hypocalciuric hypercalcemia

    - Consider further workup for these conditions, especially in a
        > younger patient.

Vasculitis – Hannah Angle

Background

- Large vessel vasculitis (aorta and its major branches)

<!-- -->

    > in contrast to GPA, no nasopharynx involvement or granulomas

- EGPA: granulomatous; predilection for heart and lungs; associated
    > with eosinophilia, chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma; uncommon \> 65
    > years old

<!-- -->

    - Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (see lab section)

    - IgA vasculitis

    - Anti-GBM disease

Takayasu's Arteritis

Presentation

- Subacute constitutional symptoms (fevers, arthralgias, myalgias,
    rash, weight loss), limb claudication, neuro symptoms from
    carotid/vertebral arteritis (vertigo, headaches, syncope, strokes),
    GI symptoms from mesenteric ischemia, angina from coronary arteritis

- HTN (renal artery involvement), discrepant BP between arms (arterial
    stenosis), diminished or absent pulses (“pulseless disease”),
    arterial bruits, carotidynia (tenderness of carotid artery)

    Evaluation

- ESR/CRP (often elevated, though can be normal during active disease)

- Arteriography: MRA or CTA of head/neck, chest, and abdomen/pelvis

    Management

- New arterial stenosis or aorta/carotid artery involvement: 1mg/kg
    prednisone daily (max 60-80mg) for 2-4 weeks followed by steroid
    taper

- Organ threatening disease (coronary artery involvement, critical
    stenosis of carotid/vertebral arteries): 500-1000mg IV
    methylprednisolone daily for 1-3 days, then 1mg/kg prednisone daily
    for 2-4 weeks followed by steroid taper

Giant Cell Arteritis

Presentation

- Always consider in pts \>50 years old with new headache, abrupt
    vision changes (diplopia, amaurosis fugax), jaw claudication,
    temporal artery tenderness

- Polymyalgia rheumatica will often accompany GCA; classically with
    bilateral shoulder and hip pain/stiffness (with elevated ESR, but
    normal CK)

Evaluation

- ESR/CRP (almost always elevated), CK, TSH

- Evaluate for any temporal artery abnormalities (tenderness to
    palpation, presence of nodules)

- Ophthalmology evaluation if any concern for ocular involvement

- Temporal artery biopsy by vascular surgery

Management

- Start glucocorticoids as soon as GCA is suspected, do not delay
    while awaiting biopsy

    - No vision loss: prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max 60 mg) for 2-4
        > weeks followed by steroid taper

    - Vision loss/diplopia: 500-1000mg IV methylprednisolone daily for
        > 3 days, followed by prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max 60mg) for 2-4
        > weeks followed by steroid taper  

Polyarteritis Nodosa (PAN)

Presentation

- Constitutional symptoms: fatigue, weakness, fevers, arthralgias,
    myalgias, rash, weight loss

- Evidence of multisystem involvement:

    - Asymmetric polyneuropathy with motor and sensory deficits (foot
        > drop, radial/ulnar neuropathy)

    - Skin manifestations: livedo reticularis, palpable purpura,
        > ulcers, tender erythematous nodules, bullae, vesicles

    - HTN (renal arteritis)

    - Abdominal pain and melena (mesenteric arteritis)

    - Ischemic cardiomyopathy (coronary arteritis)

    - Testicular pain (orchitis)

- Classically spares the lungs (consider other dx if pulmonary
    complaints)

Evaluation

- ESR/CRP, CK, TSH

- Hepatitis panel (HBV/HCV can cause secondary PAN)

- Arteriography: MRI, CT, or angiogram with classic “string of pearls”
    appearance 

- Biopsy: segmental transmural inflammation of muscular arteries,
    fibrinoid necrosis of arterial wall (no granulomas, presence
    suggests another process)

Management

- Mild disease (ex: isolated cutaneous disease): prednisone 1mg/kg
    daily (max 60-80mg) for 4 weeks followed by steroid taper

- Moderate disease: cyclophosphamide + prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max
    60-80mg) for 4 weeks followed by steroid taper

- Severe/life-threatening disease (renal failure, significant
    proteinuria, GI/cardiac/neurologic involvement): cyclophosphamide +
    500-1000mg IV methylprednisolone daily for 3 days, followed by
    prednisone 1mg/kg daily (max 60mg) for 4 weeks followed by steroid
    taper  

Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA)

Presentation

- Constitutional symptoms (fevers, fatigue, weight loss) + evidence of
    glomerulonephritis (hematuria, proteinuria), upper respiratory tract
    involvement (nasal crusting, rhinorrhea, epistaxis, sinusitis), and
    pulmonary involvement (dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis)

- Less commonly affects eyes (scleritis), skin (palpable purpura), and
    peripheral nerves (mononeuritis multiplex)

Evaluation

- ANCA + (typically PR3-cANCA)

- ESR/CRP, ANA, anti-GBM, C3/C4, cryoglobulins, HBV/HCV, HIV

- UA with microscopy (hematuria, proteinuria, RBC casts, dysmorphic
    RBCs)

- CT chest if pulmonary symptoms

- Biopsy: necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis, pauci-immune
    glomerulonephritis

- Clinical Pearl: If you suspect renal disease based (elevated Cr,
    hematuria) ask renal fellow or rheum fellow to help spin the urine
    to evaluate for RBC casting or dysmorphic cells. Quick way to
    confirm active GN, renal biopsy takes time to arrange

Management

- Mild-moderate disease: MTX + prednisone 0.5 mg/kg/day followed by
    steroid taper

- Severe disease: rituximab or cyclophosphamide + prednisone
    1mg/kg/day (60-80mg max)

    - For pts with RPGN, pulmonary hemorrhage, mononeuritis multiplex,
        > or optic neuritis: IV methylprednisolone 7-15mg/kg/day (1000mg
        > max) x 3 days for induction therapy

- DVT ppx (high risk for DVT/PE)

Microscopic Polyangiitis (MPA)

Presentation

- Similar to GPA, but without upper respiratory tract involvement;
    classically only involves lungs and kidneys

Evaluation

- ANCA + (typically MPO-pANCA)

- ESR/CRP, ANA, anti-GBM, C3/C4, cryoglobulins, HBV/HCV, HIV

- UA with microscopy (hematuria, proteinuria, RBC casts, dysmorphic
    RBCs)

- CT chest if pulmonary symptoms

- Biopsy: necrotizing vasculitis (no granulomas), pauci-immune
    glomerulonephritis

Management

- Same as GPA, see above

Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA)

Presentation

- Similar to GPA/MPA + atopic symptoms such as asthma (\>90%),
    rhinosinusitis, and peripheral eosinophilia

- Cardiac involvement (accounts for 50% deaths from EGPA): coronary
    arteritis, myocarditis, heart failure, arrhythmias

- Skin involvement (\>50%): tender subcutaneous nodules

Evaluation

- ANCA + (typically MPO-pANCA), peripheral eosinophilia

- IgE, ANA, RF, C3/C4

- Biopsy: necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis, eosinophilic
    infiltrates with fibrinoid necrosis, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis

Management

- Mild-moderate disease: prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg/day for 6-12 weeks
    followed by steroid taper

- Severe disease: cyclophosphamide + prednisone 0.5-1 mg/kg/day for
    6-12 weeks followed by steroid taper

    - For pts with life-threatening multiorgan involvement (cardiac,
        > pulmonary, renal, neurologic): IV methylprednisolone 1000mg
        > daily x 3 days for induction therapy

- DVT ppx (high risk for DVT/PE)

Inflammatory Myopathies – Greg Jackson

Background

- Inflammation and damage of skeletal muscle primarily leading to
    weakness

- Subtypes: Dermatomyositis, polymyositis, antisynthetase antibody
    syndrome associated myositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myositis,
    inclusion body myositis

- Additional myopathies: statin-induced myopathy, metabolic
    (hypothyroid, electrolyte), viral/infection myositis, diabetic
    myonecrosis

- Important point: PMR= painful, preserved strength vs inflammatory
    myopathy = painless weakness

- Hypomyopathic (or amyopathic) variants: skin and/or lungs are
    affected \>\> muscles

Presentation

- Proximal, symmetric muscle weakness in upper and lower extremities
    in all but inclusion body myositis which is typically more distal
    and asymmetric

- Dermatomyositis: skin involvement can include heliotrope rash of
    upper eyelids, Gottron’s papules (on MCP, PIP), “mechanic’s hands,”
    and shawl sign

- Raynaud’s and arthralgias can also be present

Evaluation

- Labbs: BMP, TSH, CK level, anti Jo-1 antibody

- EMG: findings indicate myopathy

- MRI extremity/affected muscle group: muscle edema

- Skin biopsy in dermatomyositis: “interface dermatitis.”

- Muscle biopsy (do not do biopsy in same muscle as EMG done)

<!-- -->

- Polymyositis, inclusion body myositis: T cell mediated muscle injury

- Dermatomyositis: immune complex/B cell mediated muscle injury

Management

- Prednisone 1 mg/kg/day for 4-6 weeks with subsequent taper

- Consult Rheumatology

- MTX or AZA used if refractory to steroids, may need IVIG, rituximab

- If statin induced: stop statin or switch to lower intensity

- If dermatomyositis: evaluate for underlying malignancy

Arthrocentesis Quick Look – Raeann Whitney

When in doubt, tap it!

- Send synovial fluid for Gram stain/culture and cell count

- Beware: Inflammatory / crystal arthropathies can have very high
    leukocyte counts!

<!-- -->

- The presence of crystals does NOT exclude septic arthritis

<!-- -->

- A fever or concern for infection in a prosthetic joint is a surgical
    emergency; ortho will come in the middle of the night to tap a joint

- Contraindications to tap: overlying cellulitis or psoriatic plaque

<!-- -->

- Anticoagulation / DVT ppx is OK (no need to hold)

| ​Arthritis Type                  | Appearance ​          | Total WBC ​              | PMNs ​ |
|---------------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| Non-inflammatory ​               | Straw like / yellow ​ | \<2000​                  | \<25%​ |
| Inflammatory / Crystalopathies ​ | Yellow / cloudy ​     | \>2000​ (often 20-50K+)  | \>50%​ |

Crystals

- Monosodium urate: needle-shaped, negatively birefringent

<!-- -->

- Sensitivity is generally good (\>90s%)

<!-- -->

- Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate: rhomboid-shaped, positively
    birefringent (weakly)

<!-- -->

- Weak birefringence significantly reduced sensitivity

General Workup

- ABCs, evaluate vital signs, mental status, pupil size, skin
    temperature and moisture

- Pulse ox, continuous cardiac monitoring, EKG, blood glucose

- UDS, acetaminophen/salicylate levels, ethanol levels, UA, BMP,
    hepatic function panel, blood gas

General Management

- Decontamination for topical exposures

- Antidotes if known ingestions/fits appropriate toxidrome

- Supportive care

- Discuss with toxicology, may be ways to enhance elimination of the
    toxin (e.g. diuresis, alkalinization, dialysis, etc.)

Management of Specific Overdoses – Lauren Chen

There are 5 main classes of drugs/toxins that induce bradycardia and
hypotension (ABCDO)

- Alpha-2 agonist

- Beta-blockers

- Calcium channel blockers

- Digoxin and cardiac glycosides

- Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (Organophosphates)

Key Points:

- Physical exam, labs, and ECG can be helpful in determining the class
    of drug/toxicant

- Ensure physical exam includes vitals (including RR) pupils,
    heart/lung exam, abdominal exam including bowel sounds, and
    peripheral pulses

- Obtain a blood glucose to differentiate beta blocker (hypoglycemia
    or normoglycemia) versus calcium channel blocker (hyperglycemia)
    toxicity

Alpha-2 Agonists

Background

- Examples: Clonidine, dexmedetomidine, guanfacine, tizanidine,
    methyldopa

- Mechanism: Centrally acting inhibition of norepinephrine release
    decreased noradrenergic activity

    Evaluation

- Physical Exam: Early/transient HTN, attenuated sympathetic response
    (decreased HR, BP), opioid toxidrome (pinpoint pupils, CNS
    depression, respiratory depression)

- Laboratory abnormalities: None associated with overdose

- ECG: Sinus bradycardia

Management

- IVF and high dose naloxone

- Naloxone may reverse the CNS and respiratory depression as well as
    hypotension

- Vasopressors such as norepinephrine/epinephrine are used if naloxone
    does not work

Quick dosing reference:

- Naloxone 10mg IVP followed by 5 mg/hr if there is no response

Beta blockers (BB’s)

Background

- Mechanism: Competitively block catecholamines at beta-adrenergic
    receptors decreased inotropy and chronotropy; impaired
    gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis

- Lipophilic BB’s (propranolol, metoprolol): Cross the blood brain
    barrier CNS depression

- Membrane stabilizing BB’s (propranolol): QRS prolongation,
    dysrhythmias, and seizures

- Sotalol: Potassium channel blocking properties QTc prolongation and
    dysrhythmias

Evaluation

- Physical Exam: CNS depression, seizures, myocardial depression,
    respiratory depression

- Laboratory abnormalities: Hypoglycemia or normoglycemia

- ECG: Sinus bradycardia, AV block (low grade), QRS widening
    (propranolol), QTc prolongation (sotalol)

Management

- IVF, Calcium

- Glucagon: Stimulates adenylcyclase increased cAMP increase HR and BP

- Epinephrine or Norepinephrine should be first line vasopressors

- Intralipid infusion if refractory HoTN or pt codes from a lipophilic
    BB (i.e. Propranolol)

- BB induced arrhythmias: Sodium bicarbonate (adjunct QRS widening)
    and Mg for QTc prolongation induced Torsades de pointes

- Hemodialysis for significant sotalol toxicity

Quick dosing reference:

- Calcium: 3g calcium gluconate

- Glucagon: 10 mg over 10 min (vomiting occurs if administered too
    fast)

    Infusion 3-5 mg/h (need infusion as half-life is 6 minutes)

- Atropine: 0.5-1mg q3-5min

- Intralipid (Lipid Emulsion) 20% infusions: 1.5 cc/kg bolus followed
    by 0.25 cc/kg/min for 60 minutes (for 70 kg adult: 1 liter over 1
    hour) for refractory hypotension or if patient codes), max dose is
    10 ml/kg or 1200 ml whichever is greater however, there is limited
    guidance on a max dose - if using lipid emulsion therapy, please
    call Toxicology or Poison Control immediately

Calcium channel blockers (CCB’s)

Background

- Two categories: Dihydropyridines (DHP) and non-dihydropyridines
    (Non-DHP)

<!-- -->

- DHP (amlodipine, nifedipine): Peripheral \> central channels,
    selectivity is lost in overdose

- Non-DHP (diltiazem, verapamil): Primarily cardiac calcium channels

<!-- -->

- Mechanism:

<!-- -->

- DHP: arterial vasodilation reflex tachycardia

- Non-DHP: peripheral vasodilation, decreased inotropy, bradycardia.
    Calcium mediated insulin inhibition in the pancreas hyperglycemia

Evaluation

- Physical Exam: Markedly preserved mental status until patient is
    about to code

- Labs: Hyperglycemia (elevated serum glucose concentrations are
    associated with severe overdose and sequelae)

- ECG: Bradyarrhythmia, high-degree heart block (3rd degree)

Management

- IVF, vasopressors if needed

- Bradycardia: Atropine (not effective for second- or third-degree
    block), calcium, glucagon

- Hypotension + bradycardia:

<!-- -->

- High dose insulin/euglycemic therapy (HIE)

    - Give with dextrose. Titrate insulin like a pressor. Blood
        pressure may take up to 20 minutes to change

    - May increase contractility through increasing the cardiac
        utilization of glucose. Not likely to help with vasodilation or
        bradycardia

- Vasopressors (norepinephrine or epinephrine). May consider
    phenylephrine for DHT induced vasoplegic shock with tachycardia

- Intralipid should be used in code/refractory hypotensive situations
    for lipophilic CCB’s (verapamil, amlodipine, diltiazem)

- Methylene blue for refractory distributive shock can be considered,
    but consult toxicology prior to using

Quick dosing reference:

- Calcium: 3g calcium gluconate

- Glucagon: 10 mg over 10 min (vomiting occurs if administered too
    fast; max 10 mg/hr)

    Infusion 3-5 mg/h (need infusion as half-life is 6 minutes)

- Atropine: 0.5-1mg q3-5min

- If hypotensive and bradycardic:

    - High-dose insulin 0.5-1 unit/kg bolus followed by 0.5-1
        > unit/kg/hour infusion titrated to up to 10 units/kg/ hour.
        > Call Toxicology immediately if exceeding 3 units/kg/hour.

    - Intralipid infusions: 20% infusions: 1.5 cc/kg bolus followed by
        > 0.25 cc/kg/min for 60 minutes (for 70 kg adult: 1 liter over 1
        > hour) for refractory hypotension or if patient codes), max
        > dose is 10 ml/kg or 1200 ml whichever is greater however,
        > there is limited guidance on a max dose - if using lipid
        > emulsion therapy, please call Toxicology or Poison Control
        > immediately

Digoxin and Cardiac Glycosides

Background

- Examples: Digoxin, yellow oleander, lanatoside C, foxglove, lily of
    the valley, bufo toads

- Mechanism: Blockade of Na/K ATPase increased intracellular calcium
    increased contractility and may delay after depolarizations/shorten
    repolarization of the atria and ventricles trigger arrhythmias;
    increased vagal tone

Evaluation

- Physical Exam: Lethargy, nausea, vomiting, reported yellow halos in
    visual fields (chronic)

- Laboratory abnormalities: Hyperkalemia (marker of acute toxicity
    although does not cause; correlates with mortality)

- ECG: Any abnormality (though Afib RVR is unlikely, more likely to
    have a regular pulse due to 3<sup>rd</sup> degree block in the
    setting of Afib), biventricular tachycardia is classic but rarely
    seen

Management

- Digoxin fab fragments

<!-- -->

- Indications: Hemodynamic instability, significant unstable
    arrhythmia, end organ damage secondary to hypoperfusion (renal
    failure), or potassium ≥5.0 mEq/L

- It can also be indicated for pts with high post distribution digoxin
    levels even if they are asymptomatic. However, please contact poison
    control/toxicology for guidance.

<!-- -->

- For pts with severe symptomatic bradycardia when digoxin fab
    fragments are not available, atropine is recommended but will likely
    not be effective

- Given the sensitivity of the myocardium with digoxin, pacers can
    trigger significant dysrhythmias and only recommended if no access
    to digoxin fab fragments or fab fragment failure

Quick reference dosing:

- Digoxin fab fragments: Number of vials = \[(serum level times the
    weight of the patient)/100\] rounded up. Empiric treatment 10 vials.
    NOTE: In acute on chronic toxicity or chronic toxicity, please
    contact the Poison Center or Medical Toxicology for guidance as less
    vials may be recommended to try to avoid adverse events from
    worsening heart failure or atrial fibrillation

<!-- -->

- Unclear dosing for natural toxins (often empirically 10 vials for an
    adult)

<!-- -->

- Atropine (if digoxin fab fragments are not available): 0.5-1mg
    q3-5min

Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors

Background

- Examples: Organophosphates (e.g. insecticides), carbamates,
    physostigmine, rivastigmine, donepezil

- Mechanism: Inhibition of the breakdown of acetylcholine increased
    acetylcholine stimulation of muscarinic and nicotinic receptors

Evaluation

- Physical Exam:

<!-- -->

- Muscarinic: Diarrhea/Diaphoresis, Urination, Miosis,
    Bronchorrhea/Bronchospasm, Bradycardia, Miosis, Emesis, Lacrimation,
    Salivation (DUMBBELS mnemonic)

- Nicotinic: Fasciculations, muscle weakness, and/or muscle paralysis

- Intermediate syndrome: Neurologic syndrome after resolution of
    cholinergic excess, decreased DTR, proximal muscle weakness,
    respiratory insufficiency, neck flexion weakness, CN abnormalities

<!-- -->

- Laboratory abnormalities: Standard lab tests are not helpful.

- ECG: Sinus bradycardia, QTc prolongation

Management

- Atropine, Pralidoxime, Benzodiazepines

- Secretions: Titrate atropine to dry secretions (can require large
    amounts i.e. 50 mg).

- Bronchorrhea: Atropine as below; excessive watery mucous from the
    lungs can cause patients to drown in their own secretions

- Organophosphate poisoning: Pralidoxime to reactivate the
    acetylcholinesterase enzyme

- Seizures: Benzodiazepines

Quick dosing reference

- Atropine: 1-2 mg (mild-moderate symptoms) vs 3-5mg (severe) IV
    repeated every 2-20 minutes or 1mg followed by doubling doses every
    5 minutes until bronchorrhea is no longer present followed by an
    infusion 10-20% of the loading dose per hour (max 2 mg/hour)

- Pralidoxime: 30mg/kg (max 2g) loading dose followed by 8-10 mg/kg/hr
    (max 650mg/hr); WHO dosing is 2000 mg bolus followed by 500 mg/hr
    infusion. Pralidoxime use for other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
    should be used only with Poison Control/Medical Toxicology guidance

Alcohol

Background

- One standard drink = 12oz regular beer = 5oz wine = 1.5oz 80%
    distilled spirit

- Absorption primarily in duodenum/small intestine (80%) with 80-90%
    of absorption in \<60 min in ideal conditions (i.e. empty stomach)

- Mechanism: Metabolism via alcohol dehydrogenase. Withdrawal due to
    CNS overactivity from decreased inhibitory tone (GABA) and
    unregulated excess excitation (glutamate binding to NMDA, dopamine)

Evaluation

- Physical Exam:

<!-- -->

- Intoxication: Slurred speech, disinhibition, incoordination,
    unsteady gait, memory impairment, nystagmus, stupor, coma,
    hypotension, tachycardia

- Wernicke encephalopathy: Encephalopathy, oculomotor dysfunction,
    gait ataxia

- Withdrawal: Anxiety, agitation, restlessness, insomnia, tremor,
    diaphoresis, palpitations, HA, n/v, hallucinations (onset 12-24h
    after last drink), seizures (12-48hr), DTs (72-96hr)

<!-- -->

- Laboratory abnormalities: EtOH level, Peth, UDS, hypoglycemia,
    hyperlactatemia, hypoK, hypoMg, hypoCa, hypophos

Management

- Intoxication: Supportive care

- Withdrawal: Thiamine, folate, multivitamin, IV fluid for
    intravascular depletion

- Psychomotor agitation: Benzodiazepines (long-acting preferred)
    including diazepam, lorazepam, and chlordiazepoxide. Lorazepam for
    acute alcoholic hepatitis/liver dysfunction.

- Seizures: CIWA scoring and benzodiazepines. If h/o DTs, consider
    phenobarbital taper. If status, consider escalation to propofol

Quick dosing reference:

- Diazepam: 5-10mg IV every 5-10min until appropriate sedation
    (severe) or per CIWA protocol

- Lorazepam: 2-4mg IV every 15-20min or per CIWA protocol

- Thiamine: Administer before glucose containing fluids. WE prevention
    100mg IV QD x3d. For WE 500mg IV TID x3d followed by 250mg QD x3d,
    then 100mg QD.

Opioids

Background

- Examples: Natural opiates (morphine, codeine), semi-synthetic
    (hydrocodone, hydromorphone, oxycodone, oxymorphone, heroin,
    buprenorphine), synthetic opioids (fentanyl, meperidine, tramadol)

- Mechanism: Multiple receptors with wide range of clinical effects
    including sedation, analgesia, respiratory depression, GI
    dysmotility, bradycardia, miosis, anxiolysis

Evaluation

- Physical Exam

    - Intoxication: AMS, miosis, hypoventilation, decreased bowel
        > sounds, seizures, coma

    - Withdrawal: Mydriasis, yawning, piloerection, diaphoresis,
        > rhinorrhea, increased BS

- Laboratory abnormalities: None specific to opioid toxicity

- ECG: QT prolongation (loperamide, methadone, very large doses of
    oxycodone), QRS widening (loperamide)

Management

- Intoxication: Supplemental oxygenation/ventilation support,
    naloxone, ACLS

    - IV naloxone preferable. However, if no IV access, apneic, or
        > patient in critical condition, can use intranasally or IM.
        > Switch to IV when able

    - Consider alternative etiologies of respiratory depression if no
        > response after 10mg

- Withdrawal: COWs scoring and protocol

    - Symptom control: ondansetron (nausea, vomiting), loperamide
        > (diarrhea), hydroxyzine (anxiety), methocarbamol (cramps),
        > dicyclomine (abdominal cramps)

    - Acute, severe: Methadone or buprenorphine, do NOT use for
        > iatrogenic withdrawal (i.e following naloxone administration)

    - Iatrogenic or patients trying to overcome addition: Clonidine
        > taper

        Quick dosing reference

- Intranasal naloxone: 4 or 8mg as single dose in one nostril. Repeat
    q2-3min, alternating nostrils

- IV naloxone: 0.4-2mg q2-3min. Consider initial lower dose
    (0.04-0.2mg) in patients with opioid dependence to avoid withdrawal
    or if concerned for concomitant stimulant overdose. However, if
    apneic, use higher doses, if mildly bradypneic in a known chronic
    user, can try smaller doses repeated every 2 minutes until patient
    is breathing at a normal rate while using bag mask ventilation to
    support the patient

- Methadone 10mg IM or 20mg PO. Usually need to discuss with psych to
    give.

- Buprenorphine 4-8mg sublingual. If symptoms persist after 60min, can
    give subsequent dose. Maximum 24mg in 24hr. Usually need to discuss
    with psych to give.

- Clonidine 0.1-0.3mg every hour until symptom resolution, maximum
    0.8mg per 24hr

Sodium Channel Blockers

Background

- Examples: Class I antiarrhythmics, tricyclic antidepressants
    (amitriptyline, imipramine) anticonvulsants (carbamazepine,
    lamotrigine), cocaine, insecticides

- Mechanism: decreases depolarization of non-nodal cardiac myocytes

- Consider other concomitant effects (e.g. TCA with anticholinergic
    and K channel blockade)

Evaluation

- Physical Exam: Depends on ingestion

<!-- -->

- Pure Na channel blockade: classically bradycardia but sodium channel
    blocking drugs often have anticholinergic properties resulting in
    tachycardia

- TCAs: typically tachycardia, cardiogenic shock, hypotension, AMS,
    seizures, respiratory depression, anticholinergic symptoms

<!-- -->

- Laboratory abnormalities: No specific abnormalities

- ECG: QRS widening, QTc prolongation, ventricular dysrhythmia (Vfib,
    Vtach, TdP), new right axis deviation

Management

- Sodium bicarbonate (mainstay)

<!-- -->

- Indications: hypotension, QTC \>100ms, QT prolongation

- Mechanism: increases serum pH and extracellular Na to help offload
    Na channels

- Goal pH: 7.5-7.55

<!-- -->

- Magnesium if arrhythmias refractory to sodium bicarb

- IVF and vasopressor support as needed

- TCA toxicity: consider lipid emulsion (discuss with poison control
    prior)

Quick dosing reference

- Sodium bicarb: Initial 1-2mEq/kg bolus q5min until pH is 7.45 to
    7.55, QRS will hopefully narrow to less than 120 msec at this pH but
    it may remain prolonged. Then recommend infusion 150mEq in 1L D5W at
    150ml/h (contact poison control or toxicology for guidance on
    discontinuation

- Intralipid infusions: 20% infusions: 1.5 cc/kg bolus followed by
    0.25 cc/kg/min for 60 minutes (for 70 kg adult: 1 liter over 1 hour)
    for refractory hypotension or if patient codes), max dose is 10
    ml/kg or 1200 ml whichever is greater however, there is limited
    guidance on a max dose - if using lipid emulsion therapy, please
    call Toxicology or Poison Control immediately

Drug Induced QTc Prolongation – Mohamed Salih

Background

- QT is measured from the start of the Q-wave to the end of the T-wave
    (use the lead with the longest measurement) and is the time of
    ventricular depolarization + repolarization

- QTc is the corrected estimate of QT assuming a rate of 60 bpm since
    QT decreases with tachycardia and increases with bradycardia

- QTcF (Fridericia) + QTcB (Bazett) on ECG are different equations and
    either may be used

<!-- -->

- QTcB tends to overestimate QT

- A 2016 Meta-analysis (PMID 27317349) recommended QTcF over QTcB

<!-- -->

- Prolongation is defined as a QT \> 440 ms in males or \>460 in
    females

<!-- -->

- Usually not very high concern until QT\> 500 ms.

<!-- -->

- Life threatening risk of prolonged QT \>500ms = Torsades de pointes
    (TdP) (see “Wide Complex Tachycardias” in the Cardiology section for
    evaluation and management of TdP).

- Two main causes of prolonged QT:

<!-- -->

- Congenital/Hereditary (long QT syndrome/channelopathies)

- Acquired (Drug induced, anorexia, bradycardia, MI/BBB, hypothermia,
    hypothyroidism, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, increased
    ICP)

    - Think of ABCDE for common offenders:

        - A: Anti”A”rrythmics (think class IA (procainamide,
            disopyramide) and class III (amiodarone, sotalol,
            dofetilide))

        - B: Anti”B”iotics: (azoles, macrolides, quinolones)

        - C: Anti”C”ychotics: 1st gen\>2nd gen (chlorpromazine,
            haloperidol, risperidone)

        - D: Anti “D”epressants: SSRIs, TCAs

        - E: Anti”E”metics: (5-HT3 antagonists) ondansetron, also
            droperidol

    - Other high risk medications: methadone, Arsenic (chemo),
        quinines (antimalarials), hydroxychloroquine

    - Special note on ondansetron (Zofran): Risk IV \> PO (ODT). Risk
        is greater if using IV dose \> 16mg, concomitant QT prolonging
        meds, concomitant other congenital and/or acquired QT
        prolongation condition

    - Conclusion: Single dosing of IV/PO Zofran without additional
        risk factors is safe, but if the patient is on other QTc
        prolonged medications or has risk factors for QTc prolongation,
        would get ECG prior to giving or before giving another dose of
        Zofran within 2 hours

Presentation

- Most commonly asymptomatic

- Other symptoms include palpitations, seizure, syncope, SCD

Evaluation

- Always evaluate with a recent EKG

- If pt is at high risk; ie: receiving antibiotics +/- antiemetics
    while inpatient with QT \>500, can monitor with EKG q 2-3 days

- It important to add QTc for crossover resident in your handoff

Management

- If stable:

<!-- -->

- Stop the offending medication (see ABCDE’s above)

- Aggressive electrolyte repletion (K and Mg especially)

- Serial EKG monitoring +/- monitor on telemetry

- If offending medication is needed, think of alternatives regimens
    (zofran scopolamine patch/alcohol wipe sniff; neutropenic ppx
    LVQ/fluconazole cefdinir/micafungin, etc.)

<!-- -->

- If unstable:

<!-- -->

- ABCs

- Defibrillation if pulseless

- Empiric IV magnesium

- If drug induced, contact cardiology for overdrive pacing as IV
    magnesium does not work

- Refer to ACLS protocol

Brown Recluse Bites (Loxoscelism) – Ashley Zeoli

Background

- Only a handful of spiders are truly harmful to humans

- The brown recluse (a member of the Loxoceles genus) is widespread in
    the South, West, and Midwest US

<!-- -->

- They are often found in homes (attics, basements, cupboards) and
    outdoors (rock piles and under tree bark)

- Their numbers increase in association with humans (i.e.
    synanthropic)

<!-- -->

- Appearance/identification:

<!-- -->

- Brown recluses have three pairs of eyes, a monochromatic abdomen and
    legs, and very fine hairs on its legs

- Using the “violin” pattern on its body is a poor way to identify
    this spider, as other harmless spiders can have similar markings.

<!-- -->

- Loxocelism is the medical manifestation of the brown recluse spider
    bite

- Venom contains insecticidal toxins, metalloproteases, and
    phospholipases

Presentation

- Bites are most common on the upper arm, thorax, or inner thigh

- Local signs:

<!-- -->

- Sometimes painless, but can cause burning sensation with two small
    cutaneous puncture marks with surrounding erythema. Pain can
    increase over the first 8 hours

- Usually appears as a red plaque or papule with central pallor and
    can sometimes present with vesiculation

- Usually self-resolves in 1 week

<!-- -->

- Skin necrosis:

<!-- -->

- In some, skin lesion can progress to necrosis overall several days

- An eschar will form that eventually ulcerates

- Usually will heal over several weeks to months

<!-- -->

- Systemic signs:

<!-- -->

- The degree of systemic effects does not correlate with the
    appearance of the bite

- Symptoms may develop over several days, and include nausea,
    vomiting, fever, rhabdomyolysis, malaise, acute hemolytic anemia,
    significant swelling from head/neck bites that can compromise the
    airway, DIC and renal failure

Evaluation

- Presumptive diagnosis is based clinical presentation of the
    bite/wound

- DDx includes vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, cellulitis, or other
    arthropod bites

- Definitive diagnosis is based upon observing a spider bite in
    combination identification by an entomologist. There is an assay for
    Loxoceles venom, but it is not commercially available

- Patients with local symptoms do not need any further workup

- Patient with any systemic symptoms require lab evaluation for more
    serious disease:

<!-- -->

- CBC, UA to eval for blood, CMP, CK

- If anemia: Type and Screen, peripheral smear, reticulocyte count,
    LDH, haptoglobin, coags to evaluate for hemolysis or DIC

Management

- Local signs:

<!-- -->

- Wound care (soap/water, elevation)

- Pain management

- Tetanus vaccine/prophylaxis if indicated

- Antibiotics only if signs of concurrent cellulitis

<!-- -->

- Skin necrosis:

<!-- -->

- Symptomatic and supportive care

- Surgical intervention can worsen cosmetic outcomes and is rarely
    indicated in the acute care setting. Skin grafting is occasionally
    needed for a very large ulcerative wound that is not healing.
    Infection is rare, Furthermore, the ulcerative base of the wounds
    often have a yellow stringy material that is not pus or infection.
    Please call Toxicology with any questions regarding brown recluse
    bites

<!-- -->

- Systemic signs:

<!-- -->

- Targeted at treatment of symptoms that develop (Consult toxicology)

- Hemolytic anemia: transfuse for Hgb \<10 + consult heme

- Rhabdomyolysis: LR for UOP \>200-300cc/hr

- If patient develops chest pain, obtain EKG and check a troponin; if
    either is abnormal please obtain echo and call Toxicology as heart
    effects (i.e. myocarditis) is something we have been seeing at VUMC

- DIC: supportive care

    additional co-signer"), make documents in OneDrive (it's
    HIPAA-compliant!) to use as your pre-rounding sheet and sign-out
    sheet and share these with your team (for days off); roll your
    pagers via Vanderbilt operator (same as at VU); ensure all orders on
    patients still in the ED are “delayed” or they will disappear once
    on the floor (ask your resident); all consults must be accompanied
    by page to the covering fellow (use Synergy for medicine
    subspecialties consult schedule, TVHS website for surgery/other),

    everything you do with your resident who is supervising a second
    intern as well, ensure all orders on pts still in the ED are

    this!), such as:

    - A simple statement for why the pt was admitted

    - Changes made to pt’s medications that you feel are important to
        highlight

    - Home instructions (daily weights, diet changes, wound care, etc)
